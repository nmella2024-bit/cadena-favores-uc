Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  This   Complete Solutions Manual   contains detailed solutions to all exercises in the text   Multivariable Calculus,   Seventh Edition (Chapters 10–17 of   Calculus,   Seventh Edition, and   Calculus: Early Transcendentals,   Seventh Edition) by James Stewart. A   Student Solutions Manual   is also available, which contains solutions to the odd-numbered exercises in each chapter section, review section, True-False Quiz, and Problems Plus section as well as all solutions to the Concept Check questions. (It does not, however, include solutions to any of the projects.) Because of differences between the regular version and the   Early Transcendentals   version of the text, some references are given in a dual format. In these cases, users of the   Early Transcendentals  text should use the references denoted by “ET.” While we have extended every effort to ensure the accuracy of the solutions presented, we would appreciate correspondence regarding any errors that may exist. Other suggestions or comments are also welcome, and can be sent to dan clegg at   dclegg@palomar.edu   or in care of the publisher: Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning, 20 Davis Drive, Belmont CA 94002-3098. We would like to thank James Stewart for entrusting us with the writing of this manual and offer- ing suggestions and Kathi Townes of TECH-arts for typesetting and producing this manual as well as creating the illustrations. We also thank Richard Stratton, Liz Covello, and Elizabeth Neustaetter of Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning, for their trust, assistance, and patience.

As   w   goes from   3    to   0 , the particle moves to   ( 3 1 >   0)   and goes back to   (0 >   1) . The particle repeats this motion as   w   goes from   0   to   2  .  23.   We must have   1   $   {   $   4   and   2   $   |   $   3 . So the graph of the curve must be contained in the rectangle   [1 >   4]   by   [2 >   3] .  24.   (a) From the   fi rst graph, we have   1   $   {   $   2 . From the second graph, we have   3 1   $   |   $   1 =   The only choice that satis fi es either of those conditions is III. (b) From the   fi rst graph, the values of   {   cycle through the values from   3 2   to   2   four times. From the second graph, the values of   |   cycle through the values from   3 2   to   2   six times. Choice I satis fi es these conditions. (c) From the   fi rst graph, the values of   {   cycle through the values from   3 2   to   2   three times. From the second graph, we have  0   $   |   $   2 . Choice IV satis fi es these conditions. (d) From the   fi rst graph, the values of   {   cycle through the values from   3 2   to   2   two times. From the second graph, the values of  |   do the same thing. Choice II satis fi es these conditions.  25.   When   w   =   3 1 ,   ( {> | ) = (0 >   3 1) . As   w   increases to   0 ,   {   decreases to   3 1   and   |  increases to   0 . As   w   increases from   0   to   1 ,   {   increases to   0   and   |   increases to   1 . As   w   increases beyond   1 , both   {   and   |   increase. For   w ?   3 1 ,   {   is positive and decreasing and   |   is negative and increasing. We could achieve greater accuracy by estimating   { - and   | -values for selected values of   w   from the given graphs and plotting the corresponding points.  26.   For   w ?   3 1 ,   {   is positive and decreasing, while   |   is negative and increasing (these points are in Quadrant IV). When   w   =   3 1 ,   ( {> | ) = (0 >   0)   and, as   w   increases from  3 1   to   0 ,   {   becomes negative and   |   increases from   0   to   1 . At   w   = 0 ,   ( {> | ) = (0 >   1)  and, as   w   increases from   0   to   1 ,   |   decreases from   1   to   0   and   {   is positive. At  w   = 1 >   ( {> | ) = (0 >   0)   again, so the loop is completed. For   w A   1 ,   {   and   |   both become large negative. This enables us to draw a rough sketch. We could achieve greater accuracy by estimating   { - and  | -values for selected values of   w   from the given graphs and plotting the corresponding points.  27.   When   w   = 0   we see that   {   = 0   and   |   = 0 , so the curve starts at the origin. As   w  increases from   0   to   1 2   , the graphs show that   |   increases from   0   to   1   while   {  increases from   0   to   1 , decreases to   0   and to   3 1 , then increases back to   0 , so we arrive at the point   (0 >   1) . Similarly, as   w   increases from   1 2   to   1 ,   |   decreases from   1  to   0   while   {   repeats its pattern, and we arrive back at the origin. We could achieve greater accuracy by estimating   { - and  | -values for selected values of   w   from the given graphs and plotting the corresponding points.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(b)   |   =   I w   D   0 .   {   =   w 2   3   2 w   =   w ( w   3   2)   is negative for   0   ? w ?   2 , so these equations are matched with graph I. (c)   {   = sin 2 w   has period   2 @ 2 =    . Note that  | ( w   + 2  ) = sin[ w   + 2    + sin 2( w   + 2  )] = sin( w   + 2    + sin 2 w ) = sin( w   + sin 2 w ) =   | ( w ) , so   |   has period   2  . These equations match graph II since   {   cycles through the values   3 1   to   1   twice as   |   cycles through those values once. (d)   {   = cos 5 w   has period   2 @ 5   and   |   = sin 2 w   has period    , so   {   will take on the values   3 1   to   1 , and then   1   to   3 1 , before   |  takes on the values   3 1   to   1 . Note that when   w   = 0 ,   ( {> | ) = (1 >   0) . These equations are matched with graph VI =  (e)   {   =   w   + sin 4 w ,   |   =   w 2   + cos 3 w .   As   w   becomes large,   w   and   w 2   become the dominant terms in the expressions for   {   and  | , so the graph will look like the graph of   |   =   { 2 , but with oscillations. These equations are matched with graph IV. (f)   {   =  sin 2 w  4 +   w 2   ,   |   =  cos 2 w  4 +   w 2   .   As   w   < " ,   {   and   |   both approach   0 . These equations are matched with graph III.  29.   Use   |   =   w   and   {   =   w   3   2 sin   w   with a   w -interval of   [ 3 >  ] .  30.   Use   { 1   =   w ,   | 1   =   w 3   3   4 w   and   { 2   =   w 3   3   4 w ,   | 2   =   w   with a   w -interval of  [ 3 3 >   3] . There are   9   points of intersection;   (0 >   0)   is fairly obvious. The point in quadrant I is approximately   (2 = 2 >   2 = 2) , and by symmetry, the point in quadrant III is approximately   ( 3 2 = 2 >   3 2 = 2) . The other six points are approximately   ( ~ 1 = 9 >   ± 0 = 5) ,   ( ~ 1 = 7 >   ± 1 = 7) , and   ( ~ 0 = 5 >   ± 1 = 9) .  31.   (a)   {   =   { 1   + ( { 2   3   { 1 ) w ,   |   =   | 1   + ( | 2   3   | 1 ) w ,   0   $   w   $   1 . Clearly the curve passes through   S 1 ( { 1 > | 1 )   when   w   = 0   and through   S 2 ( { 2 > | 2 )   when   w   = 1 . For   0   ? w ?   1 ,   {   is strictly between   { 1   and   { 2   and   |   is strictly between   | 1   and   | 2 . For every value of   w ,   {   and   |   satisfy the relation   |   3   | 1   =   | 2   3   | 1  { 2   3   { 1  ( {   3   { 1 ) , which is the equation of the line through  S 1 ( { 1 > | 1 )   and   S 2 ( { 2 > | 2 ) . Finally, any point   ( {> | )   on that line satis fi es   |   3   | 1  | 2   3   | 1  =   {   3   { 1  { 2   3   { 1  ; if we call that common value   w , then the given parametric equations yield the point   ( {> | ) ; and any   ( {> | )   on the line between   S 1 ( { 1 > | 1 )   and   S 2 ( { 2 > | 2 )   yields a value of  w   in   [0 >   1] . So the given parametric equations exactly specify the line segment from   S 1   ( { 1 > | 1 )   to   S 2 ( { 2 > | 2 ) .

For the side of the triangle from   D   to   E , use   ( { 1 > | 1 ) = (1 >   1)   and   ( { 2 > | 2 ) = (4 >   2) . Hence, the equations are  {   =   { 1   + ( { 2   3   { 1 )   w   = 1 + (4   3   1)   w   = 1 + 3 w ,  |   =   | 1   + ( | 2   3   | 1 )   w   = 1 + (2   3   1)   w   = 1 +   w . Graphing   {   = 1 + 3 w   and   |   = 1 +   w   with   0   $   w   $   1   gives us the side of the triangle from   D   to   E . Similarly, for the side   EF   we use   {   = 4   3   3 w   and   |   = 2 + 3 w , and for the side   DF   we use   {   = 1  and   |   = 1 + 4 w .  33.   The circle   { 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   = 4   has center   (0 >   1)   and radius   2 , so by Example 4 it can be represented by   {   = 2 cos   w ,  |   = 1 + 2 sin   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  . This representation gives us the circle with a counterclockwise orientation starting at   (2 >   1) . (a) To get a clockwise orientation, we could change the equations to   {   = 2 cos   w ,   |   = 1   3   2 sin   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  . (b) To get three times around in the counterclockwise direction, we use the original equations   {   = 2 cos   w ,   |   = 1 + 2 sin   w   with the domain expanded to   0   $   w   $   6  . (c) To start at   (0 >   3)   using the original equations, we must have   { 1   = 0 ; that is,   2 cos   w   = 0 . Hence,   w   =     2   . So we use  {   = 2 cos   w ,   |   = 1 + 2 sin   w ,     2   $   w   $   3   2   . Alternatively, if we want   w   to start at   0 , we could change the equations of the curve. For example, we could use  {   =   3 2 sin   w ,   |   = 1 + 2 cos   w ,   0   $   w   $    .  34.   (a) Let   { 2 @d 2   = sin 2   w   and   | 2 @e 2   = cos 2   w   to obtain   {   =   d   sin   w   and  |   =   e   cos   w   with   0   $   w   $   2    as possible parametric equations for the ellipse  { 2 @d 2   +   | 2 @e 2   = 1 . (b) The equations are   {   = 3 sin   w   and   |   =   e   cos   w   for   e   M   { 1 >   2 >   4 >   8 } . (c) As   e   increases, the ellipse stretches vertically.  35.   Big circle:   It’s centered at   (2 >   2)   with a radius of   2 , so by Example 4, parametric equations are  {   = 2 + 2 cos   w>   |   = 2 + 2 sin   w>   0   $   w   $   2   Small circles:   They are centered at   (1 >   3)   and   (3 >   3)   with a radius of   0 = 1 . By Example 4, parametric equations are  (left)   {   = 1 + 0 = 1 cos   w>   |   = 3 + 0 = 1 sin   w>   0   $   w   $   2   and   (right)   {   = 3 + 0 = 1 cos   w>   |   = 3 + 0 = 1 sin   w>   0   $   w   $   2   Semicircle:   It’s the lower half of a circle centered at   (2 >   2)   with radius   1 . By Example 4, parametric equations are  {   = 2 + 1 cos   w>   |   = 2 + 1 sin   w>      $   w   $   2   To get all four graphs on the same screen with a typical graphing calculator, we need to change the last   w -interval to [0 >   2  ]   in order to match the others. We can do this by changing   w   to   0 = 5 w . This change gives us the upper half. There are several ways to get the lower half—one is to change the “ + ” to a “ 3 ” in the   | -assignment, giving us  {   = 2 + 1 cos(0 = 5 w ) >   |   = 2   3   1 sin(0 = 5 w ) >   0   $   w   $   2   c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

F   has coordinates   ( u> u )   as in Example 7, and   T   has coordinates   ( u> u   +   u   cos(    3    )) = ( u> u (1   3   cos    ))  [since   cos(    3    ) = cos      cos      + sin      sin      =   3   cos    ], so   S   has coordinates   ( u   3   u   sin(    3    ) > u (1   3   cos    )) = ( u (    3   sin    ) > u (1   3   cos    ))  [since   sin(    3    ) = sin      cos      3   cos      sin      = sin    ]. Again we have the parametric equations   {   =   u (    3   sin    ) ,   |   =   u (1   3   cos    ) .  40.   The   fi rst two diagrams depict the case    ?  ?   3   2   ,   g ? u . As in Example 7,   F   has coordinates   ( u> u ) . Now   T   (in the second diagram) has coordinates   ( u> u   +   g   cos(    3    )) = ( u> u   3   g   cos    ) , so a typical point   S   of the trochoid has coordinates  ( u   +   g   sin(    3    ) > u   3   g   cos    ) . That is,   S   has coordinates   ( {> | ) , where   {   =   u   3   g   sin      and   |   =   u   3   g   cos    . When  g   =   u , these equations agree with those of the cycloid.  41.   It is apparent that   {   =   | RT |   and   |   =   | TS   |   =   | VW   | . From the diagram,  {   =   | RT |   =   d   cos      and   |   =   | VW   |   =   e   sin    . Thus, the parametric equations are  {   =   d   cos      and   |   =   e   sin    . To eliminate      we rearrange:   sin      =   |@e   i  sin 2      = ( |@e ) 2   and   cos      =   {@d   i   cos 2      = ( {@d ) 2 . Adding the two equations:   sin 2      + cos 2      = 1 =   { 2 @d 2   +   | 2 @e 2 . Thus, we have an ellipse.  42.   D   has coordinates   ( d   cos   > d   sin    ) . Since   RD   is perpendicular to   DE ,   { RDE   is a right triangle and   E   has coordinates  ( d   sec   >   0) . It follows that   S   has coordinates   ( d   sec   > e   sin    ) . Thus, the parametric equations are   {   =   d   sec    ,   |   =   e   sin    .  43.   F   = (2 d   cot   >   2 d ) , so the   { -coordinate of   S   is   {   = 2 d   cot    . Let   E   = (0 >   2 d ) . Then   _ RDE   is a right angle and   _ RED   =    , so   | RD |   = 2 d   sin      and  D   = ((2 d   sin    ) cos   >   (2 d   sin    ) sin    ) . Thus, the   | -coordinate of   S  is   |   = 2 d   sin 2    .  44.   (a) Let      be the angle of inclination of segment   RS   . Then   | RE |   =   2 d  cos      . Let   F   = (2 d>   0) . Then by use of right triangle   RDF   we see that   | RD |   = 2 d   cos    . Now  | RS   |   =   | DE |   =   | RE |   3   | RD |  = 2 d     1 cos      3   cos       = 2 d   1   3   cos 2     cos      = 2 d   sin 2     cos      = 2 d   sin      tan     So   S   has coordinates   {   = 2 d   sin      tan      ·   cos      = 2 d   sin 2      and   |   = 2 d   sin      tan      ·   sin      = 2 d   sin 2      tan    .

(a)   There are   2   points of intersection:  ( 3 3 >   0)   and approximately   ( 3 2 = 1 >   1 = 4) . (b) A collision point occurs when   { 1   =   { 2   and   | 1   =   | 2   for the same   w . So solve the equations:  3 sin   w   =   3 3 + cos   w   (1)  2 cos   w   = 1 + sin   w   (2)  From   (2) ,   sin   w   = 2 cos   w   3   1 . Substituting into   (1) , we get   3(2 cos   w   3   1) =   3 3 + cos   w   i   5 cos   w   = 0   ( B )   i  cos   w   = 0   i   w   =     2   or   3   2   . We check that   w   =   3   2   satis fi es   (1)   and   (2)   but   w   =     2   does not. So the only collision point occurs when   w   =   3   2   , and this gives the point   ( 3 3 >   0) . [We could check our work by graphing   { 1   and   { 2   together as functions of   w   and, on another plot,   | 1   and   | 2   as functions of   w . If we do so, we see that the only value of   w   for which   both  pairs of graphs intersect is   w   =   3   2   .] (c) The circle is centered at   (3 >   1)   instead of   ( 3 3 >   1) . There are still   2   intersection points:   (3 >   0)   and   (2 = 1 >   1 = 4) , but there are no collision points, since ( B ) in part (b) becomes   5 cos   w   = 6   i   cos   w   =   6 5   A   1 .  46.   (a) If      = 30    and   y 0   = 500   m @ s, then the equations become   {   = (500 cos 30  ) w   = 250   I 3 w   and  |   = (500 sin 30  ) w   3   1 2   (9 = 8) w 2   = 250 w   3   4 = 9 w 2 .   |   = 0   when   w   = 0   (when the gun is   fi red) and again when  w   =   250 4 = 9   E   51   s. Then   {   =    250   I 3      250 4 = 9     E   22 , 092   m, so the bullet hits the ground about   22   km from the gun. The formula for   |   is quadratic in   w . To   fi nd the maximum   | -value, we will complete the square:  |   =   3 4 = 9  w 2   3   250 4 = 9   w    =   3 4 = 9  k  w 2   3   250 4 = 9   w   +      125 4 = 9   2 l  +   125 2  4 = 9   =   3 4 = 9  w   3   125 4 = 9   2   +   125 2  4 = 9   $   125 2  4 = 9  with equality when   w   =   125 4 = 9   s, so the maximum height attained is   125 2  4 = 9   E   3189   m. (b)   As      ( 0    ?  ?   90  ) increases up to   45  , the projectile attains a greater height and a greater range. As      increases past   45  , the projectile attains a greater height, but its range decreases. (c)   {   = ( y 0   cos    ) w   i   w   =   { y 0   cos      .  |   = ( y 0   sin    ) w   3   1 2   jw 2   i   |   = ( y 0   sin    )   { y 0   cos      3   j  2     { y 0   cos      2  = (tan    ) {   3     j  2 y 2 0   cos 2       { 2 , which is the equation of a parabola (quadratic in   { ).  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

We use a graphing device to produce the graphs for various values of   f   with   3    $   w   $    . Note that all the members of the family are symmetric about the   { -axis. For   f ?   0 , the graph does not cross itself, but for   f   = 0   it has a cusp at   (0 >   0)   and for   f A   0   the graph crosses itself at   {   =   f , so the loop grows larger as   f   increases.  48.   {   = 2 fw   3   4 w 3 > |   =   3 fw 2   + 3 w 4 . We use a graphing device to produce the graphs for various values of   f   with   3    $   w   $    . Note that all the members of the family are symmetric about the   | -axis. When   f ?   0 , the graph resembles that of a polynomial of even degree, but when   f   = 0   there is a corner at the origin, and when   f A   0 , the graph crosses itself at the origin, and has two cusps below the   { -axis. The size of the “swallowtail” increases as   f   increases.  49.   {   =   w   +   d   cos   w> |   =   w   +   d   sin   w> d A   0 . From the   fi rst   fi gure, we see that curves roughly follow the line   |   =   { , and they start having loops when   d  is between   1 = 4   and   1 = 6 . The loops increase in size as   d   increases. While not required, the following is a solution to determine the   exact   values for which the curve has a loop, that is, we seek the values of   d   for which there exist parameter values   w   and   x   such that   w ? x   and  ( w   +   d   cos   w> w   +   d   sin   w ) = ( x   +   d   cos   x> x   +   d   sin   x ) . In the diagram at the left,   W   denotes the point   ( w> w ) ,   X   the point   ( x> x ) , and   S   the point   ( w   +   d   cos   w> w   +   d   sin   w ) = ( x   +   d   cos   x> x   +   d   sin   x ) . Since   S W   =   S X   =   d , the triangle   S W X   is isosceles. Therefore its base angles,      =   _ S W X   and      =   _ S XW   are equal. Since      =   w   3     4   and     = 2    3   3   4   3   x   =   5   4   3   x , the relation      =      implies that  x   +   w   =   3   2   (1) .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

For   q A   1 , we get a curve lying on or inside that circle that traces out   q   3   1   loops as   w  ranges from   0   to   2  .

It is easy to see that all the curves lie in the rectangle   [ 3 1 >   1]   by   [ 3 2 >   2] . When   f   is an integer,   { ( w   + 2  ) =   { ( w )   and  | ( w   + 2  ) =   | ( w ) , so the curve is closed. When   f   is a positive integer greater than   1 , the curve intersects the   x -axis   f   + 1   times and has   f   loops (one of which degenerates to a tangency at the origin when   f   is an odd integer of the form   4 n   + 1 ). As   f   increases, the curve’s loops become thinner, but stay in the region bounded by the semicircles   |   =   ±  1 +   I 1   3   { 2     and the line segments from   ( 3 1 >   3 1)   to   ( 3 1 >   1)   and from   (1 >   3 1)   to   (1 >   1) . This is true because  | | |   =   | sin   w   3   sin   fw |   $   | sin   w |   +   | sin   fw |   $  I 1   3   { 2   + 1 . This curve appears to   fi ll the entire region when   f   is very large, as shown in the   fi gure for   f   = 1000 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For some fractional values, such as   f   = 2 = 359 , the curve again appears to   fi ll the region.  LABORATORY PROJECT   Running Circles Around Circles 1.   The center   T   of the smaller circle has coordinates   (( d   3   e )cos   >   ( d   3   e )sin    ) . Arc   S V   on circle   F   has length   d   since it is equal in length to arc   DV  (the smaller circle rolls without slipping against the larger.) Thus,   _ S TV   =   d e     and   _ S TW   =   d e     3    , so   S   has coordinates  {   = ( d   3   e )cos      +   e   cos( _ S TW   ) = ( d   3   e )cos      +   e   cos     d   3   e e       and   |   = ( d   3   e )sin      3   e   sin( _ S TW   ) = ( d   3   e )sin      3   e   sin     d   3   e e       .  2.   With   e   = 1   and   d   a positive integer greater than   2 , we obtain a hypocycloid of   d  cusps. Shown in the   fi gure is the graph for   d   = 4 . Let   d   = 4   and   e   = 1 . Using the sum identities to expand   cos 3    and   sin 3  , we obtain  {   = 3 cos      + cos 3    = 3 cos      +    4 cos 3      3   3 cos       = 4 cos 3     and   |   = 3 sin      3   sin 3    = 3 sin      3    3 sin      3   4 sin 3       = 4 sin 3    .  3.

We conclude that as the denominator   g   increases, the graph gets smaller, but maintains the basic shape shown.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

When   q   =   g   + 1 , we obtain a hypocycloid of   q   cusps. As   q   increases, we must expand the range of      in order to get a closed curve. The following graphs have   d   =   3 2   ,   5 4   , and   11 10   .  4.   If   e   = 1 , the equations for the hypocycloid are  {   = ( d   3   1) cos      + cos (( d   3   1)    )   |   = ( d   3   1) sin      3   sin (( d   3   1)    )  which is a hypocycloid of   d   cusps (from Problem 2). In general, if   d A   1 , we get a   fi gure with cusps on the “outside ring” and if   d ?   1 , the cusps are on the “inside ring”. In any case, as the values of      get larger, we get a   fi gure that looks more and more like a washer. If we were to graph the hypocycloid for all values of    , every point on the washer would eventually be arbitrarily close to a point on the curve.  d   =   I 2 ,   3 10    $      $   10    d   =   h   3   2 ,   0   $      $   446  5.

From the graph, it appears that the rightmost point on the curve   {   =   w   3   w 6 ,   |   =   h w  is about   (0 = 6 >   2) . To   fi nd the exact coordinates, we   fi nd the value of   w   for which the graph has a vertical tangent, that is,   0 =   g{@gw   = 1   3   6 w 5   C   w   = 1 @   5  I 6 .

From the graph, it appears that the lowest point and the leftmost point on the curve  {   =   w 4   3   2 w ,   |   =   w   +   w 4   are   (1 = 5 >   3 0 = 5)   and   ( 3 1 = 2 >   1 = 2) , respectively. To   fi nd the exact coordinates, we solve   g|@gw   = 0   (horizontal tangents) and   g{@gw   = 0  (vertical tangents).  g| gw   = 0   C   1 + 4 w 3   = 0   C   w   =   3   1  3  I 4   , so the lowest point is     1  3  I 256  +   2  3  I 4   >   3   1  3  I 4  +   1  3  I 256    =     9  3  I 256   >   3   3  3  I 256    E   (1 = 42 >   3 0 = 47) .  g{ gw   = 0   C   4 w 3   3   2 = 0   C   w   =   1  3  I 2   , so the leftmost point is     1  3  I 16   3   2  3  I 2   >   1  3  I 2  +   1  3  I 16    =    3   3  3  I 16   >   3  3  I 16    E   ( 3 1 = 19 >   1 = 19) .  23.

This rectangle corresponds approximately to   w   M   [ 3 1 >   0 = 8] . We estimate that the curve has horizontal tangents at about   ( 3 1 >   3 0 = 4)   and   ( 3 0 = 17 >   0 = 39)   and vertical tangents at about   (0 >   0)   and   ( 3 0 = 19 >   0 = 37) .

It seems that we have missed one vertical tangent, and indeed if we plot the curve on the   w -interval   [ 3 1 = 2 >   2 = 2]   we see that there is another vertical tangent at   ( 3 8 >   6) .  24.   We graph the curve   {   =   w 4   + 4 w 3   3   8 w 2 ,   |   = 2 w 2   3   w   in the viewing rectangle   [ 3 3 = 7 >   0 = 2]   by   [ 3 0 = 2 >   1 = 4] . It appears that there is a horizontal tangent at about   ( 3 0 = 4 >   3 0 = 1) , and vertical tangents at about   ( 3 3 >   1)   and   (0 >   0) . We calculate   g| g{   =   g|@gw g{@gw   =   4 w   3   1 4 w 3   + 12 w 2   3   16 w   , so there is a horizontal tangent where   g|@gw   = 4 w   3   1 = 0   C   w   =   1 4   . This point (the lowest point) is shown in the   fi rst graph. There are vertical tangents where   g{@gw   = 4 w 3   + 12 w 2   3   16 w   = 0   C  4 w ( w 2   + 3 w   3   4) = 0   C   4 w ( w   + 4)( w   3   1) = 0 . We have missed one vertical tangent corresponding to   w   =   3 4 , and if we plot the graph for   w   M   [ 3 5 >   3] , we see that the curve has another vertical tangent line at approximately   ( 3 128 >   36) .  25.   {   = cos   w ,   |   = sin   w   cos   w .   g{@gw   =   3   sin   w ,   g|@gw   =   3   sin 2   w   + cos 2   w   = cos 2 w .

When   w   =   3   2   ,   g{@gw   = 1   and  g|@gw   =   3 1 . So   g|@g{   =   3 1 . Thus,   |   =   {   and   |   =   3 {   are both tangent to the curve at   (0 >   0) .  26.   From the graph, we discover that the graph of the curve   {   = cos   w   + 2 cos 2 w ,  |   = sin   w   + 2 sin 2 w   crosses itself at the point   ( 3 2 >   0) . To   fi nd   w   at   ( 3 2 >   0) , solve   |   = 0   C   sin   w   + 2 sin 2 w   = 0   C   sin   w   + 4 sin   w   cos   w   = 0   C  sin   w   (1 + 4 cos   w ) = 0   C   sin   w   = 0   or   cos   w   =   3   1 4   .

Now   g| g{   =   g|@gw g{@gw   =   cos   w   + 4 cos 2 w  3   sin   w   3   4 sin 2 w   =   3   cos   w   + 8 cos 2   w   3   4 sin   w   + 8 sin   w   cos   w   .

So at the point corresponding to parameter value   w , an equation of the tangent line is   |   3   (2 w 3   + 1) =   w [ {   3   (3 w 2   + 1)] .

Notice that   0   $   w   $   2    does not give the complete curve because  { (0)   6   =   { (2  ) . In fact, we must take   w   M   [0 >   4  ]   in order to obtain the complete curve, since the   fi rst term in each of the parametric equations has period   2    and the second has period   2   11 @ 2   =   4   11   , and the least common integer multiple of these two numbers is   4  . (b) We use the CAS to   fi nd the derivatives   g{@gw   and   g|@gw , and then use Theorem 6 to   fi nd the arc length. Recent versions of Maple express the integral   U   4   0  s ( g{@gw ) 2   + ( g|@gw ) 2   gw   as   88 H  2   I 2   l  , where   H ( { )   is the elliptic integral  ]   1 0  I 1   3   { 2 w 2  I 1   3   w 2   gw   and   l   is the imaginary number   I 3 1 . Some earlier versions of Maple (as well as Mathematica) cannot do the integral exactly, so we use the command  evalf(Int(sqrt(diff(x,t)ˆ2+diff(y,t)ˆ2),t=0..4*Pi));   to estimate the length, and   fi nd that the arc length is approximately   294 = 03 . Derive’s   Para _ arc _ length   function in the utility   fi le   Int _ apps   simpli fi es the integral to   11   U   4   0  t  3 4 cos   w   cos    11 w  2     3   4 sin   w   sin    11 w  2     + 5   gw .  56.   (a) It appears that as   w   < " ,   ( {> | )   <      1 2   >   1 2   , and as   w   < 3" ,   ( {> | )   <    3   1 2   >   3   1 2   . (b) By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,   g{@gw   = cos      2   w 2    and  g|@gw   = sin      2   w 2  , so by Formula 4, the length of the curve from the origin to the point with parameter value   w   is  O   =   U   w  0  t    g{ gx   2   +      g| gx   2   gx   =   U   w  0  t  cos 2      2   x 2    + sin 2      2   x 2    gx  =   U   w  0   1   gx   =   w   [or   3 w   if   w ?   0 ] We have used   x   as the dummy variable so as not to confuse it with the upper limit of integration.  57.   {   =   w   sin   w ,   |   =   w   cos   w ,   0   $   w   $   @ 2 .   g{@gw   =   w   cos   w   + sin   w   and   g|@gw   =   3 w   sin   w   + cos   w , so  ( g{@gw ) 2   + ( g|@gw ) 2   =   w 2   cos 2   w   + 2 w   sin   w   cos   w   + sin 2   w   +   w 2   sin 2   w   3   2 w   sin   w   cos   w   + cos 2   w  =   w 2 (cos 2   w   + sin 2   w ) + sin 2   w   + cos 2   w   =   w 2   + 1  V   =   U   2 | gv   =   U   @ 2 0   2 w   cos   w I w 2   + 1   gw   E   4 = 7394 .  58.   {   = sin   w ,   |   = sin 2 w ,   0   $   w   $   @ 2 .   g{@gw   = cos   w   and   g|@gw   = 2 cos 2 w , so   ( g{@gw ) 2   + ( g|@gw ) 2   = cos 2   w   + 4 cos 2   2 w .

The top of the arch is characterized by a horizontal tangent, and from Example 2(b) in Section 10.2, the tangent is horizontal when      = (2 q   3   1)  , so take   q   = 1   and substitute      =      into the expression for    :      =   | cos      3   1 |  (2   3   2 cos    ) 3 @ 2   =   | 3 1   3   1 |  [2   3   2( 3 1)] 3 @ 2   =  1 4   .  72.   (a) Every straight line has parametrizations of the form   {   =   d   +   yw ,   |   =   e   +   zw , where   d ,   e   are arbitrary and   y ,   z   6   = 0 . For example, a straight line passing through distinct points   ( d> e )   and   ( f> g )   can be described as the parametrized curve  {   =   d   + ( f   3   d ) w ,   |   =   e   + ( g   3   e ) w . Starting with   {   =   d   +   yw ,   |   =   e   +   zw , we compute    {   =   y ,    |   =   z ,   ¨ {   = ¨ |   = 0 , and      =   | y   ·   0   3   z   ·   0 |  ( y 2   +   z 2 ) 3 @ 2   = 0 . (b) Parametric equations for a circle of radius   u   are   {   =   u   cos      and   |   =   u   sin    . We can take the center to be the origin. So    {   =   3 u   sin      i   ¨ {   =   3 u   cos      and    |   =   u   cos      i   ¨ |   =   3 u   sin    . Therefore,     =    u 2   sin 2      +   u 2   cos 2       ( u 2   sin 2      +   u 2   cos 2    ) 3 @ 2   =   u 2  u 3   =  1  u   . And so for any      (and thus any point),      =  1  u   .  73.   The coordinates of   W   are   ( u   cos   > u   sin    ) . Since   W S   was unwound from arc   W D ,   W S   has length   u . Also   _ S W T   =   _ S W U   3   _ TW U   =   1 2      3    , so   S   has coordinates   {   =   u   cos      +   u   cos    1 2      3       =   u (cos      +      sin    ) ,  |   =   u   sin      3   u   sin    1 2      3       =   u (sin      3      cos    ) .  74.   If the cow walks with the rope taut, it traces out the portion of the involute in Exercise 73 corresponding to the range   0   $      $    , arriving at the point   ( 3 u> u )   when      =    . With the rope now fully extended, the cow walks in a semicircle of radius   u , arriving at   ( 3 u>   3 u ) . Finally, the cow traces out another portion of the involute, namely the re fl ection about the   { -axis of the initial involute path. (This corresponds to the range   3    $      $   0 .) Referring to the   fi gure, we see that the total grazing area is   2( D 1   +   D 3 ) .   D 3   is one-quarter of the area of a circle of radius   u , so   D 3   =   1 4    ( u ) 2   =   1 4    3 u 2 . We will compute  D 1   +   D 2   and then subtract   D 2   =   1 2   u 2   to obtain   D 1 . To   fi nd   D 1   +   D 2 ,   fi rst note that the rightmost point of the involute is        2   u> u  . [To see this, note that   g{@g   = 0   when     = 0   or     2   .      = 0   corresponds to the cusp at   ( u>   0)   and      =     2   corresponds to        2   u> u  .] The leftmost point of the involute is  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

LABORATORY PROJECT   Bézier Curves 1.   The parametric equations for a cubic Bézier curve are  {   =   { 0 (1   3   w ) 3   + 3 { 1 w (1   3   w ) 2   + 3 { 2 w 2 (1   3   w ) +   { 3 w 3  |   =   | 0 (1   3   w ) 3   + 3 | 1 w (1   3   w ) 2   + 3 | 2 w 2 (1   3   w ) +   | 3 w 3  where   0   $   w   $   1 . We are given the points   S 0 ( { 0 > | 0 ) = (4 >   1) ,   S 1 ( { 1 > | 1 ) = (28 >   48) ,   S 2 ( { 2 > | 2 ) = (50 >   42) , and  S 3 ( { 3 > | 3 ) = (40 >   5) . The curve is then given by  { ( w ) = 4(1   3   w ) 3   + 3   ·   28 w (1   3   w ) 2   + 3   ·   50 w 2 (1   3   w ) + 40 w 3  | ( w ) = 1(1   3   w ) 3   + 3   ·   48 w (1   3   w ) 2   + 3   ·   42 w 2 (1   3   w ) + 5 w 3  where   0   $   w   $   1 . The line segments are of the form   {   =   { 0   + ( { 1   3   { 0 ) w ,  |   =   | 0   + ( | 1   3   | 0 ) w :  S 0 S 1   {   = 4 + 24 w ,   |   = 1 + 47 w S 1 S 2   {   = 28 + 22 w ,   |   = 48   3   6 w S 2 S 3   {   = 50   3   10 w ,   |   = 42   3   37 w  2.   It suf fi ces to show that the slope of the tangent at   S 0   is the same as that of line segment   S 0 S 1 , namely   | 1   3   | 0  { 1   3   { 0  . We calculate the slope of the tangent to the Bézier curve:  g|@gw g{@gw   =   3 3 | 0 (1   3   w ) 2   + 3 | 1   3 2 w (1   3   w ) + (1   3   w ) 2    + 3 | 2   3 w 2   + (2 w )(1   3   w )    + 3 | 3 w 2  3 3 { 2 0 (1   3   w ) + 3 { 1 [ 3 2 w (1   3   w ) + (1   3   w ) 2 ] + 3 { 2 [ 3 w 2   + (2 w )(1   3   w )] + 3 { 3 w 2  At point   S 0 ,   w   = 0 , so the slope of the tangent is   3 3 | 0   + 3 | 1  3 3 { 0   + 3 { 1  =   | 1   3   | 0  { 1   3   { 0  . So the tangent to the curve at   S 0   passes through   S 1 . Similarly, the slope of the tangent at point   S 3   [where   w   = 1 ] is   3 3 | 2   + 3 | 3  3 3 { 2   + 3 { 3  =   | 3   3   | 2  { 3   3   { 2  , which is also the slope of line   S 2 S 3 .  3.   It seems that if   S 1   were to the right of   S 2 , a loop would appear. We try setting   S 1   = (110 >   30) , and the resulting curve does indeed have a loop.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Based on the behavior of the Bézier curve in Problems 1–3, we suspect that the four control points should be in an exaggerated C shape. We try   S 0 (10 >   12) ,  S 1 (4 >   15) ,   S 2 (4 >   5) , and   S 3 (10 >   8) , and these produce a decent C. If you are using a CAS, it may be necessary to instruct it to make the   { - and   | -scales the same so as not to distort the   fi gure (this is called a “constrained projection” in Maple.)  5.   We use the same   S 0   and   S 1   as in Problem 4, and use part of our C as the top of an S. To prevent the center line from slanting up too much, we move   S 2   up to  (4 >   6)   and   S 3   down and to the left, to   (8 >   7) . In order to have a smooth joint between the top and bottom halves of the S (and a symmetric S), we determine points   S 4 ,   S 5 , and   S 6   by rotating points   S 2 ,   S 1 , and   S 0   about the center of the letter (point   S 3 ). The points are therefore   S 4 (12 >   8) ,   S 5 (12 >   3 1) , and   S 6 (6 >   2) .  10.3   Polar Coordinates 1.

But   u   = 2 cos      gives the point   u   = 0   (the pole) when      = 0 .

The   fi rst implication is reversible since   cos      = 0   would imply   sin      =   u   cos 2      = 0 , contradicting the fact that   cos 2      + sin 2      = 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

We see that the graph has a similar shape for   0   $      $      and      $      $   2  .  48. 49.   {   =   u   cos      = (4 + 2 sec    ) cos      = 4 cos      + 2 .

To show that   {   = 1   is an asymptote we must prove   lim  u < ± "   {   = 1 .  {   = ( u ) cos      = (sin      tan    ) cos      = sin 2    . Now,   u   < "   i   sin      tan      < "   i     <        2   3 , so   lim  u <"   {   =   lim   < @ 2    sin 2      = 1 . Also,   u   < 3"   i   sin      tan      < 3"   i     <        2   + , so   lim  u <3"   {   =   lim   < @ 2 +   sin 2      = 1 . Therefore,   lim  u < ± "   {   = 1   i   {   = 1   is a vertical asymptote. Also notice that   {   = sin 2      D   0   for all    , and   {   = sin 2      $   1   for all    . And   {   6   = 1 , since the curve is not de fi ned at odd multiples of     2   . Therefore, the curve lies entirely within the vertical strip   0   $   { ?   1 .  52.   The equation is   ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 3   = 4 { 2 | 2 , but using polar coordinates we know that  { 2   +   | 2   =   u 2   and   {   =   u   cos      and   |   =   u   sin    . Substituting into the given equation:   u 6   = 4 u 2   cos 2    u 2   sin 2      i   u 2   = 4 cos 2      sin 2      i  u   =   ± 2 cos      sin      =   ±   sin 2  .   u   =   ±   sin 2    is sketched at right.  53.   (a) We see that the curve   u   = 1 +   f   sin      crosses itself at the origin, where   u   = 0   (in fact the inner loop corresponds to negative   u -values,) so we solve the equation of the limaçon for   u   = 0   C   f   sin      =   3 1   C   sin      =   3 1 @f . Now if  | f |   ?   1 , then this equation has no solution and hence there is no inner loop. But if   f ?   3 1 , then on the interval   (0 >   2  )  the equation has the two solutions      = sin 3 1 ( 3 1 @f )   and      =      3   sin 3 1 ( 3 1 @f ) , and if   f A   1 , the solutions are     =      + sin 3 1 (1 @f )   and      = 2    3   sin 3 1 (1 @f ) . In each case,   u ?   0   for      between the two solutions, indicating a loop. (b) For   0   ? f ?   1 , the dimple (if it exists) is characterized by the fact that   |   has a local maximum at      =   3   2   . So we determine for what   f -values   g 2 | g 2   is negative at      =   3   2   , since by the Second Derivative Test this indicates a maximum:  |   =   u   sin      = sin      +   f   sin 2      i   g| g   = cos      + 2 f   sin      cos      = cos      +   f   sin 2    i   g 2 | g 2   =   3   sin      + 2 f   cos 2  . At      =   3   2   , this is equal to   3 ( 3 1) + 2 f ( 3 1) = 1   3   2 f , which is negative only for   f A   1 2   . A similar argument shows that for   3 1   ? f ?   0 ,   |   only has a local minimum at      =     2   (indicating a dimple) for   f ?   3   1 2   .  54.   (a)   u   =   I  ,   0   $      $   16  .   u   increases as      increases and there are eight full revolutions. The graph must be either II or V. When      = 2  ,   u   =   I 2    E   2 = 5   and when      = 16  ,   u   =   I 16    E   7 , so the last revolution intersects the polar axis at approximately   3   times the distance that the   fi rst revolution intersects the polar axis, which is depicted in graph V. (b)   u   =    2 ,   0   $      $   16  .   See part (a). This is graph II. (c)   u   = cos( @ 3) .   0   $     3   $   2    i   0   $      $   6  , so this curve will repeat itself every   6    radians.  cos      3     = 0   i     3   =     2   +   q   i      =   3   2   + 3 q , so there will be two “pole” values,   3   2   and   9   2   . This is graph VI. (d)   u   = 1 + 2 cos      is a limaçon [see Exercise 53(a)] with   f   = 2 . This is graph III.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

It appears that the graph of   u   = 1 + sin     3     6     is the same shape as the graph of   u   = 1 + sin    , but rotated counterclockwise about the origin by     6   . Similarly, the graph of   u   = 1 + sin     3     3     is rotated by    3   . In general, the graph of   u   =   i   (    3    )   is the same shape as that of  u   =   i   (  ) , but rotated counterclockwise through      about the origin. That is, for any point   ( u 0 >  0 )   on the curve   u   =   i   (  ) , the point  ( u 0 >  0   +    )   is on the curve   u   =   i   (    3    ) , since   u 0   =   i (  0 ) =   i   ((  0   +    )   3    ) .  74.

Consider curves with polar equation   u   = 1 +   f   cos    , where   f   is a real number. If   f   = 0 , we get a circle of radius   1   centered at the pole. For   0   ? f   $   0 = 5 , the curve gets slightly larger, moves right, and   fl attens out a bit on the left side. For   0 = 5   ? f ?   1 , the left side has a dimple shape. For   f   = 1 , the dimple becomes a cusp. For   f A   1 , there is an internal loop. For   f   D   0 , the rightmost point on the curve is   (1 +   f>   0) . For   f ?   0 , the curves are re fl ections through the vertical axis of the curves with   f A   0 .  f   = 0 = 25   f   = 0 = 75   f   = 1   f   = 2  76.   Consider the polar curves   u   = 1 + cos q    , where   q   is a positive integer. First, let  q   be an even positive integer . The   fi rst   fi gure shows that the curve has a peanut shape for   q   = 2 , but as   q   increases, the ends are squeezed. As   q   becomes large, the curves look more and more like the unit circle, but with spikes to the points  (2 >   0)   and   (2 >  ) .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

This is because in the case of   q   odd, every point on the graph is traversed twice, due to the fact that  u (    +    ) = sin[ q (    +    )] = sin   q   cos   q   + cos   q   sin   q   =  + sin   q   if   q   is even  3   sin   q   if   q   is odd (b) The graph of   u   =   | sin   q |   has   2 q   loops whether   q   is odd or even, since   u (    +    ) =   u (  ) .  q   = 2   q   = 3   q   = 4   q   = 5  2.   u   = 1 +   f   sin   q .

As   f   increases toward   0 , the entire graph gets smaller (the graphs below are not to scale) and the smaller loops shrink in relation to the large ones. At   f   =   3 1 , the small loops disappear entirely, and for   3 1   ? f ?   1 , the graph is a simple, closed curve (at   f   = 0   it is a circle). As   f   continues to increase, the same changes are seen, but in reverse order, since   1 + ( 3 f ) sin   q   = 1 +   f   sin   q (    +    ) , so the graph for   f   =   f 0   is the same as that for   f   =   3 f 0 , with a rotation through    . As   f   < " , the smaller loops get relatively closer in size to the large ones. Note that the distance between the outermost points of corresponding inner and outer loops is always   2 . Maple’s   animate   command (or Mathematica’s  Animate ) is very useful for seeing the changes that occur as   f   varies.  q   = 3  f   =   3 4   f   =   3 1 = 4   f   =   3 1   f   =   3 0 = 8  f   =   3 0 = 2   f   = 0   f   = 0 = 5   f   = 8  3.   u   =  1   3   d   cos     1 +   d   cos      . We start with   d   = 0 , since in this case the curve is simply the circle   u   = 1 . As   d   increases, the graph moves to the left, and its right side becomes   fl attened. As   d   increases through about   0 = 4 , the right side seems to grow a dimple, which upon closer investigation (with narrower    -ranges) seems to appear at   d   E   0 = 42   [the actual value is   I 2   3   1 ]. As   d   <   1 , this dimple becomes more pronounced, and the curve begins to stretch out horizontally, until at   d   = 1   the denominator vanishes at      =    , and the dimple becomes an actual cusp. For   d A   1   we must choose our parameter interval carefully, since   u   < "   as   1 +   d   cos      <   0   C      <   ±   cos 3 1 ( 3 1 @d ) . As   d   increases from   1 , the curve splits into two parts. The left part has a loop, which grows larger as   d   increases, and the right part grows broader vertically, and its left tip develops a dimple when   d   E   2 = 42   [actually,   I 2 + 1 ]. As   d   increases, the dimple grows more and more pronounced. If   d ?   0 , we get the same graph as we do for the corresponding positive   d -value, but with a rotation through     about the pole, as happened when   f   was replaced with   3 f   in Exercise 2.

We note that the given equation,   u 4   3   2 f 2 u 2   cos 2    +   f 4   3   d 4   = 0 , is a quadratic in   u 2 , so we use the quadratic formula and   fi nd that  u 2   =  2 f 2   cos 2    ±   s 4 f 4   cos 2   2    3   4( f 4   3   d 4 ) 2   =   f 2   cos 2    ±   s d 4   3   f 4   sin 2   2   so   u   =   ±  t  f 2   cos 2    ±   s d 4   3   f 4   sin 2   2  . So for each graph, we must plot four curves to be sure of plotting all the points which satisfy the given equation. Note that all four functions have period    . We start with the case   d   =   f   = 1 , and the resulting curve resembles the symbol for in fi nity. If we let   d   decrease, the curve splits into two symmetric parts, and as   d   decreases further, the parts become smaller, further apart, and rounder. If instead we let   d   increase from   1 , the two lobes of the curve join together, and as   d   increases further they continue to merge, until at  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Clearly the pole is a point of intersection.   sin 2    = cos 2    i  tan 2    = 1   i   2    =     4   + 2 q   [since   sin 2    and   cos 2    must be positive in the equations]   i      =     8   +   q   i      =     8   or   9   8   . So the curves also intersect at     1  4 I 2   >     8    and     1  4 I 2   >   9   8    .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The parabola with vertex   (0 >   0)   and focus   (1 >   0)   opens to the right and has   s   = 1 , so its equation is   | 2   = 4 s{ , or   | 2   = 4 { .  32.   The parabola with focus   (0 >   0)   and directrix   |   = 6   has vertex   (0 >   3)   and opens downward, so   s   =   3 3   and its equation is  ( {   3   0) 2   = 4 s ( |   3   3) , or   { 2   =   3 12( |   3   3) .  33.   The distance from the focus   ( 3 4 >   0)   to the directrix   {   = 2   is   2   3   ( 3 4) = 6 , so the distance from the focus to the vertex is  1 2   (6) = 3   and the vertex is   ( 3 1 >   0) . Since the focus is to the left of the vertex,   s   =   3 3 . An equation is   | 2   = 4 s ( {   + 1)   i  | 2   =   3 12( {   + 1) .  34.   The distance from the focus   (3 >   6)   to the vertex   (3 >   2)   is   6   3   2 = 4 . Since the focus is above the vertex,   s   = 4 . An equation is   ( {   3   3) 2   = 4 s ( |   3   2)   i   ( {   3   3) 2   = 16( |   3   2) .  35.   A parabola with vertical axis and vertex   (2 >   3)   has equation   |   3   3 =   d ( {   3   2) 2 . Since it passes through   (1 >   5) , we have  5   3   3 =   d (1   3   2) 2   i   d   = 2 , so an equation is   |   3   3 = 2( {   3   2) 2 .  36.   A parabola with horizontal axis has equation   {   =   d| 2   +   e|   +   f . Since the parabola passes through the point   ( 3 1 >   0) , substitute   3 1   for   {   and   0   for   | :   3 1 = 0 + 0 +   f . Now with   f   =   3 1 , substitute   1   for   {   and   3 1   for   | :   1 =   d   3   e   3   1   (1) ; and then   3   for   {   and   1   for   | :   3 =   d   +   e   3   1   (2) =   Add   (1)   and   (2)   to get   4 = 2 d   3   2   i   d   = 3   and then   e   = 1 . Thus, the equation is   {   = 3 | 2   +   |   3   1 .  37.   The ellipse with foci   ( ± 2 >   0)   and vertices   ( ± 5 >   0)   has center   (0 >   0)   and a horizontal major axis, with   d   = 5   and   f   = 2 , so   e 2   =   d 2   3   f 2   = 25   3   4 = 21 . An equation is   { 2  25  +   | 2  21  = 1 .  38.   The ellipse with foci   (0 >   ± 5)   and vertices   (0 >   ± 13)   has center   (0 >   0)   and a vertical major axis, with   f   = 5   and   d   = 13 , so   e   =   I d 2   3   f 2   = 12 . An equation is   { 2  144  +   | 2  169  = 1 .  39.   Since the vertices are   (0 >   0)   and   (0 >   8) , the ellipse has center   (0 >   4)   with a vertical axis and   d   = 4 . The foci at   (0 >   2)   and   (0 >   6)  are 2 units from the center, so   f   = 2   and   e   =   I d 2   3   f 2   =   I 4 2   3   2 2   =   I 12 . An equation is   ( {   3   0) 2  e 2   +  ( |   3   4) 2  d 2   = 1   i  { 2  12  +  ( |   3   4) 2  16   = 1 .  40.   Since the foci are   (0 >   3 1)   and   (8 >   3 1) , the ellipse has center   (4 >   3 1)   with a horizontal axis and   f   = 4 . The vertex   (9 >   3 1)   is 5 units from the center, so   d   = 5   and   e   =   I d 2   3   f 2   =   I 5 2   3   4 2   =   I 9 . An equation is  ( {   3   4) 2  d 2   +  ( |   + 1) 2  e 2   = 1   i   ( {   3   4) 2  25   +  ( |   + 1) 2  9   = 1 .  41.   An equation of an ellipse with center   ( 3 1 >   4)   and vertex   ( 3 1 >   0)   is   ( {   + 1) 2  e 2   +  ( |   3   4) 2  4 2   = 1 . The focus   ( 3 1 >   6)   is   2   units from the center, so   f   = 2 . Thus,   e 2   + 2 2   = 4 2   i   e 2   = 12 , and the equation is   ( {   + 1) 2  12   +  ( |   3   4) 2  16   = 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The ellipse passes through   S   ( 3 4 >   1 = 8) , so  2 d   =   | S I 1 |   +   | S I 2 |   i   2 d   = 1 = 8 +   s 8 2   + (1 = 8) 2   i   2 d   = 1 = 8 + 8 = 2   i   d   = 5 .  e 2   =   d 2   3   f 2   = 25   3   16 = 9   and the equation is   { 2  25  +   | 2  9   = 1 .  43.   An equation of a hyperbola with vertices   ( ± 3 >   0)   is   { 2  3 2   3   | 2  e 2   = 1 . Foci   ( ± 5 >   0)   i   f   = 5   and   3 2   +   e 2   = 5 2   i  e 2   = 25   3   9 = 16 , so the equation is   { 2  9   3   | 2  16  = 1 .  44.   An equation of a hyperbola with vertices   (0 >   ± 2)   is   | 2  2 2   3   { 2  e 2   = 1 . Foci   (0 >   ± 5)   i   f   = 5   and   2 2   +   e 2   = 5 2   i  e 2   = 25   3   4 = 21 , so the equation is   | 2  4   3   { 2  21  = 1 .  45.   The center of a hyperbola with vertices   ( 3 3 >   3 4)   and   ( 3 3 >   6)   is   ( 3 3 >   1) , so   d   = 5   and an equation is  ( |   3   1) 2  5 2   3   ( {   + 3) 2  e 2   = 1 . Foci   ( 3 3 >   3 7)   and   ( 3 3 >   9)   i   f   = 8 , so   5 2   +   e 2   = 8 2   i   e 2   = 64   3   25 = 39   and the equation is   ( |   3   1) 2  25   3   ( {   + 3) 2  39   = 1 .  46.   The center of a hyperbola with vertices   ( 3 1 >   2)   and   (7 >   2)   is   (3 >   2) , so   d   = 4   and an equation is   ( {   3   3) 2  4 2   3   ( |   3   2) 2  e 2   = 1 . Foci   ( 3 2 >   2)   and   (8 >   2)   i   f   = 5 , so   4 2   +   e 2   = 5 2   i   e 2   = 25   3   16 = 9   and the equation is  ( {   3   3) 2  16   3   ( |   3   2) 2  9   = 1 .  47.   The center of a hyperbola with vertices   ( ± 3 >   0)   is   (0 >   0) , so   d   = 3   and an equation is   { 2  3 2   3   | 2  e 2   = 1 . Asymptotes   |   =   ± 2 {   i   e d   = 2   i   e   = 2(3) = 6   and the equation is   { 2  9   3   | 2  36  = 1 .  48.   The center of a hyperbola with foci   (2 >   0)   and   (2 >   8)   is   (2 >   4) , so   f   = 4   and an equation is   ( |   3   4) 2  d 2   3   ( {   3   2) 2  e 2   = 1 . The asymptote   |   = 3 +   1 2   {   has slope   1 2   , so   d e   =  1 2   i   e   = 2 d   and   d 2   +   e 2   =   f 2   i   d 2   + (2 d ) 2   = 4 2   i  5 d 2   = 16   i   d 2   =   16 5   and so   e 2   = 16   3   16 5   =   64 5   . Thus, an equation is   ( |   3   4) 2  16 @ 5   3   ( {   3   2) 2  64 @ 5   = 1 .  49.   In Figure 8, we see that the point on the ellipse closest to a focus is the closer vertex (which is a distance  d   3   f   from it) while the farthest point is the other vertex (at a distance of   d   +   f ). So for this lunar orbit,  ( d   3   f ) + ( d   +   f ) = 2 d   = (1728 + 110) + (1728 + 314) , or   d   = 1940 ; and   ( d   +   f )   3   ( d   3   f ) = 2 f   = 314   3   110 , or   f   = 102 . Thus,   e 2   =   d 2   3   f 2   = 3 , 753 , 196 , and the equation is   { 2  3 , 763 , 600  +   | 2  3 , 753 , 196  = 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The function whose graph is the upper branch of this hyperbola is concave upward. The function is  |   =   i ( { ) =   d  u  1 +   { 2  e 2   =   d e  I e 2   +   { 2 , so   | 0   =   d e  { ( e 2   +   { 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   and  | 00   =   d e  k  ( e 2   +   { 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   3   { 2 ( e 2   +   { 2 ) 3 3 @ 2  l  =   de ( e 2   +   { 2 ) 3 3 @ 2   A   0   for all   { , and so   i   is concave upward.  54.   We can follow exactly the same sequence of steps as in the derivation of Formula 4, except we use the points   (1 >   1)   and  ( 3 1 >   3 1)   in the distance formula ( fi rst equation of that derivation) so   s ( {   3   1) 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   +   s ( {   + 1) 2   + ( |   + 1) 2   = 4  will lead (after moving the second term to the right, squaring, and simplifying) to   2   s ( {   + 1) 2   + ( |   + 1) 2   =   {   +   |   + 4 , which, after squaring and simplifying again, leads to   3 { 2   3   2 {|   + 3 | 2   = 8 .  55.   (a) If   n A   16 , then   n   3   16   A   0 , and   { 2  n   +   | 2  n   3   16  = 1   is an   ellipse   since it is the sum of two squares on the left side. (b) If   0   ? n ?   16 , then   n   3   16   ?   0 , and   { 2  n   +   | 2  n   3   16  = 1   is a   hyperbola   since it is the difference of two squares on the left side. (c) If   n ?   0 , then   n   3   16   ?   0 , and there is   no curve   since the left side is the sum of two negative terms, which cannot equal 1. (d) In case (a),   d 2   =   n ,   e 2   =   n   3   16 , and   f 2   =   d 2   3   e 2   = 16 , so the foci are at   ( ± 4 >   0) .

This line passes through the point   ( d>   3 s )   on the directrix, so   3 s   3   { 2 0  4 s   =   { 0  2 s   ( d   3   { 0 )   i   3 4 s 2   3   { 2 0   = 2 d{ 0   3   2 { 2 0   C  { 2 0   3   2 d{ 0   3   4 s 2   = 0   C   { 2 0   3   2 d{ 0   +   d 2   =   d 2   + 4 s 2   C  ( { 0   3   d ) 2   =   d 2   + 4 s 2   C   { 0   =   d   ±   s d 2   + 4 s 2 . The slopes of the tangent lines at   {   =   d   ±   s d 2   + 4 s 2  are   d   ±   s d 2   + 4 s 2  2 s   , so the product of the two slopes is  d   +   s d 2   + 4 s 2  2 s   ·   d   3   s d 2   + 4 s 2  2 s   =   d 2   3   ( d 2   + 4 s 2 ) 4 s 2   =   3 4 s 2  4 s 2   =   3 1 , showing that the tangent lines are perpendicular.  58.

Similarly,   | 2   =   E 2 e 2 ( d 2   3   D 2 )  e 2 D 2   +   d 2 E 2   . Next we   fi nd the slopes of the tangent lines of the curves:   { 2  d 2   +   | 2  e 2   = 1   i   2 { d 2   +  2 || 0  e 2   = 0   i   || 0  e 2   =   3   { d 2   i  | 0  H   =   3   e 2  d 2  { |   and   { 2  D 2   3   | 2  E 2   = 1   i   2 { D 2   3   2 || 0  E 2   = 0   i   || 0  E 2   =   { D 2   i   | 0  K   =   E 2  D 2  { |   .

Since   d 2   3   e 2   =   f 2   and   D 2   +   E 2   =   f 2 , we have   d 2   3   e 2   =   D 2   +   E 2   i   d 2   3   D 2   =   e 2   +   E 2 , so the product of the slopes is   3 1 , and hence, the tangent lines at each point of intersection are perpendicular.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Since “ 3 h   sin      ” appears in the denominator, the directrix is below the focus at the origin.   g   =   | I o |   =   1 2   , so an equation of the directrix is   |   =   3   1 2   .

If the hyperbola is rotated about its focus (the origin) through an angle   @ 3 , its equation is the same as that of the original, with      replaced by      3     3  (see Example 4), so   u   =   4 5 + 6 cos     3     3     .  19.   For   h ?   1   the curve is an ellipse. It is nearly circular when   h   is close to   0 . As   h  increases, the graph is stretched out to the right, and grows larger (that is, its right-hand focus moves to the right while its left-hand focus remains at the origin.) At   h   = 1 , the curve becomes a parabola with focus at the origin.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a) The value of   g   does not seem to affect the shape of the conic (a parabola) at all, just its size, position, and orientation (for   g ?   0   it opens upward, for  g A   0   it opens downward). (b) We consider only positive values of   h . When   0   ? h ?   1 , the conic is an ellipse. As   h   <   0 + , the graph approaches perfect roundness and zero size. As   h   increases, the ellipse becomes more elongated, until at   h   = 1   it turns into a parabola. For   h A   1 , the conic is a hyperbola, which moves downward and gets broader as   h   continues to increase.  h   = 0 = 1  h   = 0 = 5   h   = 0 = 9   h   = 1  h   = 1 = 1   h   = 1 = 5   h   = 10  21.   | S I   |   =   h   | S o |   i   u   =   h [ g   3   u   cos(    3    )] =   h ( g   +   u   cos    )   i  u (1   3   h   cos    ) =   hg   i   u   =   hg  1   3   h   cos     22.   | S I   |   =   h   | S o |   i   u   =   h [ g   3   u   sin    ]   i   u (1 +   h   sin    ) =   hg   i  u   =   hg  1 +   h   sin     c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

By (7), we have  u   =   d (1   3   h 2 ) 1 +   h   cos      =  7 = 8   ×   10 8 [1   3   (0 = 048) 2 ] 1 + 0 = 048 cos      E   7 = 78   ×   10 8  1 + 0 = 048 cos     27.   Here   2 d   =   length of major axis   = 36 = 18   AU   i   d   = 18 = 09   AU and   h   = 0 = 97 . By (7), the equation of the orbit is  u   =  18 = 09[1   3   (0 = 97) 2 ] 1 + 0 = 97 cos      E   1 = 07 1 + 0 = 97 cos      .

Here   2 d   =   length of major axis   = 356 = 5   AU   i   d   = 178 = 25   AU and   h   = 0 = 9951 .

The minimum distance is at perihelion, where   4 = 6   ×   10 7   =   u   =   d (1   3   h ) =   d (1   3   0 = 206) =   d (0 = 794)   i  d   = 4 = 6   ×   10 7 @ 0 = 794 .

(a) A parametric curve is a set of points of the form   ( {> | ) = ( i   ( w ) > j ( w )) , where   i   and   j   are continuous functions of a variable   w . (b) Sketching a parametric curve, like sketching the graph of a function, is dif fi cult to do in general. We can plot points on the curve by   fi nding   i ( w )   and   j ( w )   for various values of   w , either by hand or with a calculator or computer. Sometimes, when  i   and   j   are given by formulas, we can eliminate   w   from the equations   {   =   i   ( w )   and   |   =   j ( w )   to get a Cartesian equation relating   {   and   | . It may be easier to graph that equation than to work with the original formulas for   {   and   |   in terms of   w .  2.

(a) A hyperbola is a set of points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two   fi xed points (the foci) is a constant. This difference should be interpreted as the larger distance minus the smaller distance. (b)   { 2  d 2   3   | 2  f 2   3   d 2   = 1  (c)   |   =   ±  I f 2   3   d 2  d   {  9.

False.   Consider the curve de fi ned by   {   =   i   ( w ) = ( w   3   1) 3   and   |   =   j ( w ) = ( w   3   1) 2 . Then   j 0 ( w ) = 2( w   3   1) , so   j 0 (1) = 0 , but its graph has a   vertical   tangent when   w   = 1 .   Note:   The statement is true if   i   0 (1)   6   = 0   when   j 0 (1) = 0 .  2.   False.   If   {   =   i   ( w )   and   |   =   j ( w )   are twice differentiable, then   g 2 | g{ 2   =   g g{     g| g{    =  g gw     g| g{    g{ gw  .  3.   False.   For example, if   i   ( w ) = cos   w   and   j ( w ) = sin   w   for   0   $   w   $   4  , then the curve is a circle of radius 1, hence its length is   2  , but   U   4   0  s [ i   0 ( w )] 2   + [ j 0 ( w )] 2   gw   =   U   4   0  s ( 3   sin   w ) 2   + (cos   w ) 2   gw   =   U   4   0   1   gw   = 4  , since as   w   increases from   0   to   4  , the circle is traversed twice.  4.   False.   If   ( u>  ) = (1 >  ) , then   ( {> | ) = ( 3 1 >   0) , so   tan 3 1 ( |@{ ) = tan 3 1   0 = 0   6   =    . The statement is true for points in quadrants I and IV.  5.   True.   The curve   u   = 1   3   sin 2    is unchanged if we rotate it through   180    about   R   because  1   3   sin 2(    +    ) = 1   3   sin(2    + 2  ) = 1   3   sin 2  . So it’s unchanged if we replace   u   by   3 u . (See the discussion after Example 8 in Section 10.3.) In other words, it’s the same curve as   u   =   3 (1   3   sin 2  ) = sin 2    3   1 .  6.   True.   The polar equation   u   = 2 , the Cartesian equation   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 , and the parametric equations   {   = 2 sin 3 w ,  |   = 2 cos 3 w   [ 0   $   w   $   2  ] all describe the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The   fi rst pair of equations gives the portion of the parabola   |   =   { 2   with   {   D   0 , whereas the second pair of equations traces out the whole parabola   |   =   { 2 .  8.

True.   By rotating and translating the parabola, we can assume it has an equation of the form   |   =   f{ 2 , where   f A   0 . The tangent at the point    d> fd 2    is the line   |   3   fd 2   = 2 fd ( {   3   d ) ; i.e.,   |   = 2 fd{   3   fd 2 . This tangent meets the parabola at the points    {> f{ 2    where   f{ 2   = 2 fd{   3   fd 2 . This equation is equivalent to   { 2   = 2 d{   3   d 2  [since   f A   0 ]. But   { 2   = 2 d{   3   d 2   C   { 2   3   2 d{   +   d 2   = 0   C   ( {   3   d ) 2   = 0   C   {   =   d   C   {> f{ 2    =    d> fd 2  .

The ellipse with foci   ( ± 4 >   0)   and vertices   ( ± 5 >   0)   has center   (0 >   0)   and a horizontal major axis, with   d   = 5   and   f   = 4 , so   e 2   =   d 2   3   f 2   = 5 2   3   4 2   = 9 . An equation is   { 2  25  +   | 2  9   = 1 .  50.   The distance from the focus   (2 >   1)   to the directrix   {   =   3 4   is   2   3   ( 3 4) = 6 , so the distance from the focus to the vertex is   1 2   (6) = 3   and the vertex is   ( 3 1 >   1) . Since the focus is to the right of the vertex,   s   = 3 . An equation is  ( |   3   1) 2   = 4   ·   3[ {   3   ( 3 1)] , or   ( |   3   1) 2   = 12( {   + 1) .  51.   The center of a hyperbola with foci   (0 >   ± 4)   is   (0 >   0) , so   f   = 4   and an equation is   | 2  d 2   3   { 2  e 2   = 1 .

Thus, an equation is   | 2  72 @ 5   3   { 2  8 @ 5  = 1 , or   5 | 2  72   3   5 { 2  8   = 1 .  52.   Center is   (3 >   0) , and   d   =   8 2   = 4 ,   f   = 2   C   e   =   I 4 2   3   2 2   =   I 12   i  an equation of the ellipse is   ( {   3   3) 2  12   +   | 2  16  = 1 .  53.   { 2   =   3 ( |   3   100)   has its vertex at   (0 >   100) , so one of the vertices of the ellipse is   (0 >   100) . Another form of the equation of a parabola is   { 2   = 4 s ( |   3   100)   so   4 s ( |   3   100) =   3 ( |   3   100)   i   4 s   =   3 1   i   s   =   3   1 4   .

If   h A   1 , then   1   3   h 2   ?   0   and Equations 10.6.4 become   d 2   =   h 2 g 2  ( h 2   3   1) 2   and  e 2   =   h 2 g 2  h 2   3   1   , so   e 2  d 2   =   h 2   3   1 . The asymptotes   |   =   ±   e d  {   have slopes   ±   e d   =   ± I h 2   3   1 , so the angles they make with the polar axis are   ±   tan 3 1  I h 2   3   1      = cos 3 1 ( ± 1 @h ) .  57.   (a) If   ( d> e )   lies on the curve, then there is some parameter value   w 1   such that   3 w 1  1 +   w 3 1  =   d   and   3 w 2 1  1 +   w 3 1  =   e . If   w 1   = 0 , the point is   (0 >   0) , which lies on the line   |   =   { . If   w 1   6   = 0 , then the point corresponding to   w   =  1  w 1  is given by  {   =   3(1 @w 1 ) 1 + (1 @w 1 ) 3   =   3 w 2 1  w 3 1   + 1  =   e ,   |   =   3(1 @w 1 ) 2  1 + (1 @w 1 ) 3   =   3 w 1  w 3 1   + 1  =   d . So   ( e> d )   also lies on the curve. [Another way to see this is to do part (e)   fi rst; the result is immediate.] The curve intersects the line   |   =   {   when   3 w  1 +   w 3   =   3 w 2  1 +   w 3   i  w   =   w 2   i   w   = 0   or   1 , so the points are   (0 >   0)   and      3 2   >   3 2   .

Using the symmetry from part (a), we see that there are vertical tangents at  (0 >   0)   and      3  I 4 >   3  I 2    . (c) Notice that as   w   < 3 1 + , we have   {   < 3"   and   |   < " . As   w   < 3 1 3 , we have   {   < "   and   |   < 3" . Also  |   3   ( 3 {   3   1) =   |   +   {   + 1 =  3 w   + 3 w 2   + (1 +   w 3 ) 1 +   w 3   =  ( w   + 1) 3  1 +   w 3   =   ( w   + 1) 2  w 2   3   w   + 1   <   0   as   w   < 3 1 . So   |   =   3 {   3   1   is a slant asymptote.

So   g| g{   =   g|@gw g{@gw   =   w (2   3   w 3 ) 1   3   2 w 3   . Also   g 2 | g{ 2   =  g gw     g| g{    g{@gw   =   2(1 +   w 3 ) 4  3(1   3   2 w 3 ) 3   A   0   C   w ?   1  3  I 2   . So the curve is concave upward there and has a minimum point at   (0 >   0)  and a maximum point at      3  I 2 >   3  I 4  .

Near the point   (0 >   1) , the denominator of   | 0   is positive and the numerator changes from negative to positive as   {   increases through   0 , so   (0 >   1)   is a local minimum point.

Thus, the maximum value of   {   is   3 4  I 3 , and, by symmetry, the minimum value is   3   3 4  I 3 . Therefore, the smallest viewing rectangle that contains every member of the family of polar curves  u   = 1 +   f   sin    , where   0   $   f   $   1 , is    3   3 4  I 3 >   3 4  I 3      ×   [ 3 1 >   2] .  4.   (a) Let us   fi nd the polar equation of the path of the bug that starts in the upper right corner of the square. If the polar coordinates of this bug, at a particular moment, are   ( u>  ) , then the polar coordinates of the bug that it is crawling toward must be    u>    +     2   . (The next bug must be the same distance from the origin and the angle between the lines joining the bugs to the pole must be     2   .) The Cartesian coordinates of the   fi rst bug are  ( u   cos   > u   sin    )   and for the second bug we have  {   =   u   cos       +     2     =   3 u   sin    ,   |   =   u   sin       +     2     =   u   cos    . So the slope of the line joining the bugs is  u   cos      3   u   sin     3 u   sin      3   u   cos      =  sin      3   cos     sin      + cos      . This must be equal to the slope of the tangent line at   ( u>  ) , so by Equation 10.3.3 we have   ( gu@g ) sin      +   u   cos     ( gu@g ) cos      3   u   sin      =  sin      3   cos     sin      + cos      .

Solving this differential equation as a separable equation (as in Section 9.3), or using Theorem 9.4.2 with   n   =   3 1 , we get   u   =   Fh 3    . To determine   F   we use the fact that, at its starting position,      =     4   and   u   =   1 I 2   d , so   1 I 2   d   =   Fh 3 @ 4   i   F   =   1 I 2   dh @ 4 .

Use implicit differentiation to get  2 { d 2   3   2 | | 0  e 2   = 0 , so   | 0   =   e 2 { d 2 |   . The tangent line at the point   ( f> g )   on the hyperbola has equation   |   3   g   =   e 2 f d 2 g   ( {   3   f ) . The tangent line intersects the asymptote   |   =   e d  {   when   e d  {   3   g   =   e 2 f d 2 g   ( {   3   f )   i   deg{   3   d 2 g 2   =   e 2 f{   3   e 2 f 2   i  deg{   3   e 2 f{   =   d 2 g 2   3   e 2 f 2   i   {   =   d 2 g 2   3   e 2 f 2  e ( dg   3   ef )   =   dg   +   ef e   and the   | -value is   e d dg   +   ef e   =   dg   +   ef d   . Similarly, the tangent line intersects   |   =   3   e d  {   at     ef   3   dg e   >  dg   3   ef d    . The midpoint of these intersection points is     1 2     dg   +   ef e   +   ef   3   dg e    >   1 2     dg   +   ef d   +   dg   3   ef d    =     1 2 2 ef e   >   1 2 2 dg d    = ( f> g ) , the point of tangency.  Note:   If   |   = 0 , then at   ( ± d>   0) , the tangent line is   {   =   ± d , and the points of intersection are clearly equidistant from the point of tangency.  6.   (a) Since the smaller circle rolls without slipping around   F , the amount of arc traversed on   F   ( 2 u   in the   fi gure) must equal the amount of arc of the smaller circle that has been in contact with   F . Since the smaller circle has radius   u , it must have turned through an angle of   2 u@u   = 2  . In addition to turning through an angle   2  , the little circle has rolled through an angle      against   F . Thus,   S   has turned through an angle of   3    as shown in the   fi gure. (If the little circle had turned through an angle of   2    with its center pinned to the   { -axis, then   S   would have turned only   2    instead of   3  . The movement of the little circle around   F   adds      to the angle.) From the  fi gure, we see that the center of the small circle has coordinates   (3 u   cos   >   3 u   sin    ) . Thus,   S   has coordinates   ( {> | ) , where  {   =   e   cos 3    + 3 u   cos      and   |   =   e   sin 3    + 3 u   sin    . (b)  e   =   1 5   u   e   =   2 5   u   e   =   3 5   u   e   =   4 5   u  (c) The diagram gives an alternate description of point   S   on the epitrochoid.   T   moves around a circle of radius   e , and   S   rotates one-third as fast with respect to   T   at a distance of   3 u . Place an equilateral triangle with sides of length   3 I 3 u   so that its centroid is at   T   and one vertex is at   S   . (The distance from the centroid to a vertex is   1 I 3   times the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.)  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

At the same time,   S   (and the rest of the triangle) rotate through an angle of   2   3   about   T , so   S   ’s position is occupied by another vertex. In this way, we see that the epitrochoid traced out by   S   is simultaneously traced out by the other two vertices as well. The whole equilateral triangle sits inside the epitrochoid (touching it only with its vertices) and each vertex traces out the curve once while the centroid moves around the circle three times. (d) We view the epitrochoid as being traced out in the same way as in part (c), by a rotor for which the distance from its center to each vertex is   3 u , so it has radius   6 u . To show that the rotor   fi ts inside the epitrochoid, it suf fi ces to show that for any position of the tracing point   S   , there are no points on the opposite side of the rotor which are outside the epitrochoid. But the most likely case of intersection is when   S   is on the   | -axis, so as long as the diameter of the rotor    which is   3   I 3   u      is less than the distance between the   | -intercepts, the rotor will   fi t. The   | -intercepts occur when      =     2   or      =   3   2   i  |   =   3 e   + 3 u   or   |   =   e   3   3 u , so the distance between the intercepts is   ( 3 e   + 3 u )   3   ( e   3   3 u ) = 6 u   3   2 e , and the rotor will  fi t if   3   I 3   u   $   6 u   3   2 e   C   2 e   $   6 u   3   3   I 3   u   C   e   $   3 2   2   3  I 3      u .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

If   | u |   D   1 , then   { u q }   diverges by (9), so   { qu q }   diverges also, since   | qu q |   =   q   | u q |   D   | u q | .

(a) Let   lim  q <"   d q   =   O . By De fi nition 2, this means that for every   % A   0   there is an integer   Q   such that   | d q   3   O |   ? %  whenever   q A Q . Thus,   | d q +1   3   O |   ? %   whenever   q   + 1   A Q   C   q A Q   3   1 . It follows that   lim  q <"   d q +1   =   O   and so  lim  q <"   d q   =   lim  q <"   d q +1 . (b) If   O   =   lim  q <"   d q   then   lim  q <"   d q +1   =   O   also, so   O   must satisfy   O   = 1 @   (1 +   O )   i   O 2   +   O   3   1 = 0   i   O   =   3 1 +   I 5 2  (since   O   has to be nonnegative if it exists).  71.   Since   { d q }   is a decreasing sequence,   d q   A d q +1   for all   q   D   1 . Because all of its terms lie between   5   and   8 ,   { d q }   is a bounded sequence. By the Monotonic Sequence Theorem,   { d q }   is convergent; that is,   { d q }   has a limit   O .   O   must be less than  8   since   { d q }   is decreasing, so   5   $   O ?   8 .  72.   The terms of   d q   = ( 3 2) q +1   alternate in sign, so the sequence is not monotonic. The   fi rst   fi ve terms are   4 ,   3 8 ,   16 ,   3 32 , and   64 . Since   lim  q <"   | d q |   =   lim  q <"   2 q +1   =   " , the sequence is not bounded.  73.   d q   =   1 2 q   + 3   is decreasing since   d q +1   =   1 2( q   + 1) + 3  =   1 2 q   + 5   ?   1 2 q   + 3  =   d q   for each   q   D   1 . The sequence is bounded since   0   ? d q   $   1 5   for all   q   D   1 . Note that   d 1   =   1 5   .  74.   d q   =  2 q   3   3 3 q   + 4   de fi nes an increasing sequence since for   i   ( { ) =  2 {   3   3 3 {   + 4   ,  i   0 ( { ) =  (3 {   + 4)(2)   3   (2 {   3   3)(3) (3 {   + 4) 2   =   17 (3 {   + 4) 2   A   0 . The sequence is bounded since   d q   D   d 1   =   3   1 7   for   q   D   1 , and   d q   ?   2 q   3   3 3 q   ?   2 q  3 q   =  2 3   for   q   D   1 .  75.   The terms of   d q   =   q ( 3 1) q   alternate in sign, so the sequence is not monotonic. The   fi rst   fi ve terms are   3 1 ,   2 ,   3 3 ,   4 , and   3 5 . Since   lim  q <"   | d q |   =   lim  q <"   q   =   " , the sequence is not bounded.  76.   d q   =   qh 3 q   de fi nes a positive decreasing sequence since the function   i   ( { ) =   {h 3 {   is decreasing for   { A   1 .  [ i   0 ( { ) =   h 3 {   3   {h 3 {   =   h 3 { (1   3   { )   ?   0   for   { A   1 .] The sequence is bounded above by   d 1   =   1  h   and below by 0.  77.   d q   =   q q 2   + 1   de fi nes a decreasing sequence since for   i   ( { ) =   { { 2   + 1   ,   i   0 ( { ) =  ( { 2   + 1)(1)   3   { (2 { ) ( { 2   + 1) 2   =   1   3   { 2  ( { 2   + 1) 2   $   0  for   {   D   1 . The sequence is bounded since   0   ? d q   $   1 2   for all   q   D   1 .  78.   d q   =   q   +  1  q   de fi nes an increasing sequence since the function   j ( { ) =   {   +  1  {   is increasing for   { A   1 .

Alternate solution : Let   O   =   lim  q <"   d q . (We could show the limit exists by showing that   { d q }   is bounded and increasing.) Then   O   must satisfy   O   =   I 2   ·   O   i   O 2   = 2 O   i   O ( O   3   2) = 0 .   O   6   = 0   since the sequence increases, so   O   = 2 .  80.   (a) Let   S q   be the statement that   d q +1   D   d q   and   d q   $   3 .   S 1   is obviously true. We will assume that   S q   is true and then show that as a consequence   S q +1   must also be true.   d q +2   D   d q +1   C   I 2 +   d q +1   D  I 2 +   d q   C  2 +   d q +1   D   2 +   d q   C   d q +1   D   d q , which is the induction hypothesis.   d q +1   $   3   C   I 2 +   d q   $   3   C  2 +   d q   $   9   C   d q   $   7 , which is certainly true because we are assuming that   d q   $   3 . So   S q   is true for all   q , and so  d 1   $   d q   $   3   (showing that the sequence is bounded), and hence by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem,   lim  q <"   d q   exists. (b) If   O   =   lim  q <"   d q , then   lim  q <"   d q +1   =   O   also, so   O   =   I 2 +   O   i   O 2   = 2 +   O   C   O 2   3   O   3   2 = 0   C  ( O   + 1)( O   3   2) = 0   C   O   = 2   [since   O   can’t be negative].  81.   d 1   = 1 ,   d q +1   = 3   3   1  d q  .   We show by induction that   { d q }   is increasing and bounded above by   3 . Let   S q   be the proposition that   d q +1   A d q   and   0   ? d q   ?   3 . Clearly   S 1   is true. Assume that   S q   is true. Then   d q +1   A d q   i   1  d q +1  ?   1  d q  i 3   1  d q +1  A   3   1  d q  . Now   d q +2   = 3   3   1  d q +1  A   3   3   1  d q  =   d q +1   C   S q +1 . This proves that   { d q }   is increasing and bounded above by   3 , so   1 =   d 1   ? d q   ?   3 , that is,   { d q }   is bounded, and hence convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. If   O   =   lim  q <"   d q , then   lim  q <"   d q +1   =   O   also, so   O   must satisfy   O   = 3   3   1 @O   i   O 2   3   3 O   + 1 = 0   i   O   =   3   ±   I 5 2   . But   O A   1 , so   O   =   3 +   I 5 2   .  82.   d 1   = 2 ,   d q +1   =   1 3   3   d q  .   We use induction. Let   S q   be the statement that   0   ? d q +1   $   d q   $   2 . Clearly   S 1   is true, since  d 2   = 1 @ (3   3   2) = 1 . Now assume that   S q   is true. Then   d q +1   $   d q   i   3 d q +1   D 3 d q   i   3   3   d q +1   D   3   3   d q   i  d q +2   =   1 3   3   d q +1  $   1 3   3   d q  =   d q +1 . Also   d q +2   A   0   [since   3   3   d q +1   is positive] and   d q +1   $   2   by the induction hypothesis, so   S q +1   is true. To   fi nd the limit, we use the fact that   lim  q <"   d q   =   lim  q <"   d q +1   i   O   =   1 3   3   O   i  O 2   3   3 O   + 1 = 0   i   O   =   3   ±   I 5 2   . But   O   $   2 , so we must have   O   =   3   3  I 5 2   .  83.   (a) Let   d q   be the number of rabbit pairs in the   n th month. Clearly   d 1   = 1 =   d 2 . In the   n th month, each pair that is  2   or more months old (that is,   d q 3 2   pairs) will produce a new pair to add to the   d q 3 1   pairs already present. Thus,  d q   =   d q 3 1   +   d q 3 2 , so that   { d q }   =   { i q } , the Fibonacci sequence.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(b) By repeatedly pressing the cosine key on the calculator (that is, taking cosine of the previous answer) until the displayed value stabilizes, we see that   O   E   0 = 73909 .  85.   (a)   From the graph, it appears that the sequence     q 5  q !    converges to   0 , that is,   lim  q <"  q 5  q !  = 0 . (b) From the   fi rst graph, it seems that the smallest possible value of   Q   corresponding to   %   = 0 = 1   is   9 , since   q 5 @q !   ?   0 = 1  whenever   q   D   10 , but   9 5 @ 9!

Theorem 6:   If   lim  q <"   | d q |   = 0   then   lim  q <"   3   | d q |   = 0 , and since   3   | d q |   $   d q   $   | d q | , we have that   lim  q <"   d q   = 0   by the Squeeze Theorem.  88.

To Prove:   If   lim  q <"   d q   = 0   and   { e q }   is bounded, then   lim  q <" ( d q e q ) = 0 .  Proof:   Since   { e q }   is bounded, there is a positive number   P   such that   | e q |   $   P   and hence,   | d q | | e q |   $   | d q |   P   for all   q   D   1 . Let   % A   0   be given. Since   lim  q <"   d q   = 0 , there is an integer   Q   such that   | d q   3   0 |   ?   % P   if   q A Q . Then  | d q e q   3   0 |   =   | d q e q |   =   | d q | | e q |   $   | d q |   P   =   | d q   3   0 |   P ?   % P   ·   P   =   %   for all   q A Q . Since   %   was arbitrary,  lim  q <" ( d q e q ) = 0 .  90.   (a)   e q +1   3   d q +1  e   3   d   =   e q   +   e q 3 1 d   +   e q 3 2 d 2   +   e q 3 3 d 3   +   · · ·   +   ed q 3 1   +   d q  ? e q   +   e q 3 1 e   +   e q 3 2 e 2   +   e q 3 3 e 3   +   · · ·   +   ee q 3 1   +   e q   = ( q   + 1) e q  (b) Since   e   3   d A   0 , we have   e q +1   3   d q +1   ?   ( q   + 1) e q ( e   3   d )   i   e q +1   3   ( q   + 1) e q ( e   3   d )   ? d q +1   i  e q [( q   + 1) d   3   qe ]   ? d q +1 . (c) With this substitution,   ( q   + 1) d   3   qe   = 1 , and so   e q   =    1 +  1  q   q  ? d q +1   =    1 +   1  q   + 1   q +1  . (d) With this substitution, we get    1 +   1 2 q   q    1 2    ?   1   i    1 +   1 2 q   q  ?   2   i    1 +   1 2 q   2 q  ?   4 . (e)   d q   ? d 2 q   since   { d q }   is increasing, so   d q   ? d 2 q   ?   4 . (f ) Since   { d q }   is increasing and bounded above by   4 ,   d 1   $   d q   $   4 , and so   { d q }   is bounded and monotonic, and hence has a limit by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem.  91.   (a) First we show that   d A d 1   A e 1   A e .  d 1   3   e 1   =   d   +   e  2   3  I de   =   1 2    d   3   2 I de   +   e    =   1 2   I d   3  I e   2  A   0   [since   d A e ]   i   d 1   A e 1 . Also  d   3   d 1   =   d   3   1 2   ( d   +   e ) =   1 2   ( d   3   e )   A   0   and   e   3   e 1   =   e   3  I de   =   I e   I e   3  I d    ?   0 , so   d A d 1   A e 1   A e . In the same way we can show that   d 1   A d 2   A e 2   A e 1   and so the given assertion is true for   q   = 1 . Suppose it is true for   q   =   n , that is,  d n   A d n +1   A e n +1   A e n . Then  d n +2   3   e n +2   =   1 2   ( d n +1   +   e n +1 )   3   s d n +1 e n +1   =   1 2    d n +1   3   2 s d n +1 e n +1   +   e n +1    =   1 2   I d n +1   3   s e n +1   2  A   0 ,  d n +1   3   d n +2   =   d n +1   3   1 2   ( d n +1   +   e n +1 ) =   1 2   ( d n +1   3   e n +1 )   A   0 , and  e n +1   3   e n +2   =   e n +1   3   s d n +1 e n +1   =   s e n +1   s e n +1   3  I d n +1    ?   0   i   d n +1   A d n +2   A e n +2   A e n +1 , so the assertion is true for   q   =   n   + 1 . Thus, it is true for all   q   by mathematical induction. (b) From part (a) we have   d A d q   A d q +1   A e q +1   A e q   A e , which shows that both sequences,   { d q }   and   { e q } , are monotonic and bounded. So they are both convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Then   lim  q <"   d q +1   =   lim  q <"  d q   +   e q  2   i      =      +     2   i  2    =      +      i      =    .  92.   (a) Let   % A   0 . Since   lim  q <"   d 2 q   =   O , there exists   Q 1   such that   | d 2 q   3   O |   ? %   for   q A Q 1 . Since   lim  q <"   d 2 q +1   =   O , there exists   Q 2   such that   | d 2 q +1   3   O |   ? %   for   q A Q 2 . Let   Q   = max   { 2 Q 1 >   2 Q 2   + 1 }   and let   q A Q . If   q   is even, then  q   = 2 p   where   p A Q 1 , so   | d q   3   O |   =   | d 2 p   3   O |   ? % . If   q   is odd, then   q   = 2 p   + 1 , where   p A Q 2 , so  | d q   3   O |   =   | d 2 p +1   3   O |   ? % . Therefore   lim  q <"   d q   =   O . (b)   d 1   = 1 ,   d 2   = 1 +   1 1 + 1   =   3 2   = 1 = 5 ,   d 3   = 1 +   1 5 @ 2   =   7 5   = 1 = 4 ,   d 4   = 1 +   1 12 @ 5   =   17 12   = 1 = 416 ,  d 5   = 1 +   1 29 @ 12   =   41 29   E   1 = 413793 ,   d 6   = 1 +   1 70 @ 29   =   99 70   E   1 = 414286 ,   d 7   = 1 +   1 169 @ 70   =   239 169   E   1 = 414201 ,  d 8   = 1 +   1 408 @ 169   =   577 408   E   1 = 414216 . Notice that   d 1   ? d 3   ? d 5   ? d 7   and   d 2   A d 4   A d 6   A d 8 . It appears that the odd terms are increasing and the even terms are decreasing. Let’s prove that   d 2 q 3 2   A d 2 q   and   d 2 q 3 1   ? d 2 q +1   by mathematical induction. Suppose that   d 2 n 3 2   A d 2 n . Then   1 +   d 2 n 3 2   A   1 +   d 2 n   i   1 1 +   d 2 n 3 2  ?   1 1 +   d 2 n  i  1 +   1 1 +   d 2 n 3 2  ?   1 +   1 1 +   d 2 n  i   d 2 n 3 1   ? d 2 n +1   i   1 +   d 2 n 3 1   ?   1 +   d 2 n +1   i  1 1 +   d 2 n 3 1  A   1 1 +   d 2 n +1  i   1 +   1 1 +   d 2 n 3 1  A   1 +   1 1 +   d 2 n +1  i   d 2 n   A d 2 n +2 . We have thus shown, by induction, that the odd terms are increasing and the even terms are decreasing. Also all terms lie between   1   and   2 , so both  { d q }   and   { e q }   are bounded monotonic sequences and are therefore convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Let  lim  q <"   d 2 q   =   O . Then   lim  q <"   d 2 q +2   =   O   also. We have  d q +2   = 1 +   1 1 + 1 + 1 @ (1 +   d q )  = 1 +   1 (3 + 2 d q ) @ (1 +   d q )  =  4 + 3 d q  3 + 2 d q  so   d 2 q +2   =  4 + 3 d 2 q  3 + 2 d 2 q  . Taking limits of both sides, we get   O   =  4 + 3 O  3 + 2 O   i   3 O   + 2 O 2   = 4 + 3 O   i   O 2   = 2   i  O   =   I 2   [since   O A   0 ]. Thus,   lim  q <"   d 2 q   =   I 2 . Similarly we   fi nd that   lim  q <"   d 2 q +1   =   I 2 . So, by part (a),  lim  q <"   d q   =   I 2 .  93.   (a) Suppose   { s q }   converges to   s . Then   s q +1   =   es q  d   +   s q  i   lim  q <"   s q +1   =  e   lim  q <"   s q  d   + lim  q <"   s q  i   s   =   es d   +   s   i  s 2   +   ds   =   es   i   s ( s   +   d   3   e ) = 0   i   s   = 0   or   s   =   e   3   d . (b)   s q +1   =   es q  d   +   s q  =     e d    s q  1 +   s q  d ?     e d    s q   since   1 +   s q  d   A   1 .

We   fi rst show, by induction, that if   s 0   ? e   3   d , then   s q   ? e   3   d   and   s q +1   A s q . For   q   = 0 , we have   s 1   3   s 0   =   es 0  d   +   s 0  3   s 0   =   s 0 ( e   3   d   3   s 0 )  d   +   s 0  A   0   since   s 0   ? e   3   d . So   s 1   A s 0 . Now we suppose the assertion is true for   q   =   n , that is,   s n   ? e   3   d   and   s n +1   A s n   . Then  e   3   d   3   s n +1   =   e   3   d   3   es n  d   +   s n  =   d ( e   3   d ) +   es n   3   ds n   3   es n  d   +   s n  =   d ( e   3   d   3   s n )  d   +   s n  A   0   because   s n   ? e   3   d . So  s n +1   ? e   3   d . And   s n +2   3   s n +1   =   es n +1  d   +   s n +1  3   s n +1   =   s n +1 ( e   3   d   3   s n +1 )  d   +   s n +1  A   0   since   s n +1   ? e   3   d . Therefore,  s n +2   A s n +1 . Thus, the assertion is true for   q   =   n   + 1 . It is therefore true for all   q   by mathematical induction. A similar proof by induction shows that if   s 0   A e   3   d , then   s q   A e   3   d   and   { s q }   is decreasing. In either case the sequence   { s q }   is bounded and monotonic, so it is convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. It then follows from part (a) that   lim  q <"   s q   =   e   3   d .

There seem to be some some   fl eeting patterns in these graphs, but on the whole they are certainly very chaotic. As   n   increases, the graph spreads out vertically, with more extreme values close to   0  or   1 .  11.2   Series 1.

A series is divergent if it is not convergent.  2.   " S  q =1  d q   = 5   means that by adding suf fi ciently many terms of the series we can get as close as we like to the number   5 .

We draw lines from the centers of the   F l   to the center of   G   (or   F ), and using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can write  1 2   +    1   3   1 2   g 1   2   =    1 +   1 2   g 1   2   C  1 =    1 +   1 2   g 1   2   3    1   3   1 2   g 1   2   = 2 g 1   [difference of squares]   i   g 1   =   1 2   .

If we actually calculate   g 2   and   g 3   from the formulas above, we   fi nd that they are   1 6  =   1 2   ·   3   and  1 12  =   1 3   ·   4   respectively, so we suspect that in general,   g q   =   1  q ( q   + 1)   . To prove this, we use induction: Assume that for all  n   $   q ,   g n   =   1  n ( n   + 1)  =  1  n   3   1  n   + 1   . Then   q S  l =1  g l   = 1   3   1  q   + 1  =   q q   + 1   [telescoping sum]. Substituting this into our formula for   g q +1 , we get   g q +1   =    1   3   q q   + 1   2  2   3     q q   + 1     = 1 ( q   + 1) 2  q   + 2  q   + 1 =   1 ( q   + 1)( q   + 2)   , and the induction is complete. Now, we observe that the partial sums   S q l =1   g l   of the diameters of the circles approach   1   as   q   < " ; that is,  " S  q =1  d q   =   " S  q =1  1  q ( q   + 1)  = 1 , which is what we wanted to prove.  78.   | FG |   =   e   sin    ,   | GH |   =   | FG |   sin      =   e   sin 2    ,   | HI   |   =   | GH |   sin      =   e   sin 3    ,   = = =   .

The series   1   3   1 + 1   3   1 + 1   3   1 +   · · ·   diverges (geometric series with   u   =   3 1 ) so we cannot say that  0 = 1   3   1 + 1   3   1 + 1   3   1 +   · · ·   .  80.   If   " S  q =1  d q   is convergent, then   lim  q <"   d q   = 0   by Theorem 6, so   lim  q <"  1  d q  6   = 0 , and so   " S  q =1  1  d q  is divergent by the Test for Divergence.  81.

If   S   fd q   were convergent, then   S (1 @f )( fd q ) =   S   d q   would be also, by Theorem 8(i). But this is not the case, so   S   fd q  must diverge.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Then   S ( d q   +   e q )   and   S   d q   are convergent series. So by Theorem 8(iii),   S   [( d q   +   e q )   3   d q ]   would also be convergent. But   S   [( d q   +   e q )   3   d q ] =   S   e q , a contradiction, since  S   e q   is given to be divergent.  84.   No. For example, take   S   d q   =   S   q   and   S   e q   =   S ( 3 q ) , which both diverge, yet   S ( d q   +   e q ) =   S   0 , which converges with sum   0 .  85.   The partial sums   { v q }   form an increasing sequence, since   v q   3   v q 3 1   =   d q   A   0   for all   q . Also, the sequence   { v q }   is bounded since   v q   $   1000   for all   q .

(a) At the   fi rst step, only the interval      1 3   >   2 3     (length   1 3   ) is removed. At the second step, we remove the intervals      1 9   >   2 9     and     7 9   >   8 9   , which have a total length of   2   ·      1 3   2 . At the third step, we remove   2 2   intervals, each of length      1 3   3 . In general, at the   n th step we remove   2 q 3 1   intervals, each of length      1 3   q , for a length of   2 q 3 1   ·      1 3   q   =   1 3     2 3   q 3 1 . Thus, the total length of all removed intervals is   " S  q =1 1 3     2 3   q 3 1   =   1 @ 3 1   3   2 @ 3   = 1    geometric series with   d   =   1 3   and   u   =   2 3   . Notice that at the   q th step, the leftmost interval that is removed is      1 3   q   >      2 3   q  , so we never remove   0 , and   0   is in the Cantor set. Also, the rightmost interval removed is    1   3      2 3   q   >   1   3      1 3   q  , so   1   is never removed. Some other numbers in the Cantor set are   1 3   ,   2 3   ,   1 9   ,   2 9   ,   7 9   , and   8 9   .

In general, the area removed at the   q th step is   (8) q 3 1    1 9   q   =   1 9     8 9   q 3 1 , so the total area of all removed squares is  " S  q =1  1 9     8 9   q 3 1  =   1 @ 9 1   3   8 @ 9  = 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Note that the limits appear to be “weighted” more toward   d 2 . In general, we guess that the limit is   d 1   + 2 d 2  3   .

Now we can write  d q   =   d 1   + ( d 2   3   d 1 ) + ( d 3   3   d 2 ) +   · · ·   + ( d q 3 1   3   d q 3 2 ) + ( d q   3   d q 3 1 ) =   d 1   +   q 3 1 S  n =1  ( d n +1   3   d n ) =   d 1   +   q 3 1 S  n =1   3   1 2   n 3 1   ( d 2   3   d 1 )  and so  lim  q <"   d q   =   d 1   + ( d 2   3   d 1 )   " S  n =1   3   1 2   n 3 1   =   d 1   + ( d 2   3   d 1 )     1 1   3   ( 3 1 @ 2)    =   d 1   +   2 3   ( d 2   3   d 1 ) =   d 1   + 2 d 2  3   .  89.   (a) For   " S  q =1  q  ( q   + 1)!   ,   v 1   =   1 1   ·   2  =  1 2   ,   v 2   =  1 2  +   2 1   ·   2   ·   3  =  5 6   ,   v 3   =  5 6  +   3 1   ·   2   ·   3   ·   4  =  23 24   ,  v 4   =  23 24  +   4 1   ·   2   ·   3   ·   4   ·   5  =  119 120   . The denominators are   ( q   + 1)! , so a guess would be   v q   =  ( q   + 1)!   3   1 ( q   + 1)!   . (b) For   q   = 1 ,   v 1   =  1 2  =  2!   3   1 2!   , so the formula holds for   q   = 1 . Assume   v n   =  ( n   + 1)!   3   1 ( n   + 1)!   . Then  v n +1   =  ( n   + 1)!   3   1 ( n   + 1)!   +   n   + 1 ( n   + 2)!  =  ( n   + 1)!   3   1 ( n   + 1)!   +   n   + 1 ( n   + 1)!( n   + 2)  =  ( n   + 2)!   3   ( n   + 2) +   n   + 1 ( n   + 2)! =  ( n   + 2)!   3   1 ( n   + 2)!  Thus, the formula is true for   q   =   n   + 1 . So by induction, the guess is correct. (c)   lim  q <"   v q   =   lim  q <"  ( q   + 1)!   3   1 ( q   + 1)!   =   lim  q <"    1   3   1 ( q   + 1)!    = 1   and so   " S  q =1  q  ( q   + 1)!  = 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The function   i   ( { ) =  cos 2   {  1 +   { 2   is not decreasing on   [1 >   " ) , so the hypotheses of the Integral Test are not satis fi ed for the series   " S  q =1  cos 2   q  1 +   q 2   .  29.   We have already shown (in Exercise 21) that when   s   = 1   the series   " S  q =2  1  q (ln   q ) s   diverges, so assume that   s   6   = 1 .  i   ( { ) =   1  { (ln   { ) s   is continuous and positive on   [2 >   " ) , and   i   0 ( { ) =   3   s   + ln   { { 2 (ln   { ) s +1   ?   0   if   { A h 3 s , so that   i   is eventually decreasing and we can use the Integral Test.  ]   "  2  1  { (ln   { ) s   g{   = lim  w <"     (ln   { ) 1 3 s  1   3   s   w  2  [for   s   6   = 1 ]   = lim  w <"     (ln   w ) 1 3 s  1   3   s   3   (ln 2) 1 3 s  1   3   s    This limit exists whenever   1   3   s ?   0   C   s A   1 , so the series converges for   s A   1 .  30.   i   ( { ) =   1  {   ln   {   [ln(ln   { )] s   is positive and continuous on   [3 >   " ) . For   s   D   0 ,   i   clearly decreases on   [3 >   " ) ; and for   s ?   0 , it can be veri fi ed that   i   is ultimately decreasing. Thus, we can apply the Integral Test.

Clearly the series cannot converge if   s   D 3   1 2   , because then   lim  q <"   q (1 +   q 2 ) s   6   = 0 . So assume   s ?   3   1 2   . Then  i   ( { ) =   { (1 +   { 2 ) s   is continuous, positive, and eventually decreasing on   [1 >   " ) , and we can use the Integral Test.  ]   "  1  { (1 +   { 2 ) s g{   = lim  w <"     1 2   ·   (1 +   { 2 ) s +1  s   + 1   w  1  =   1 2( s   + 1)  lim  w <"   [(1 +   w 2 ) s +1   3   2 s +1 ] . This limit exists and is   fi nite   C   s   + 1   ?   0   C   s ?   3 1 , so the series converges whenever   s ?   3 1 .  32.   If   s   $   0 ,   lim  q <"  ln   q q s   =   "   and the series diverges, so assume   s A   0 .   i   ( { ) =  ln   { { s   is positive and continuous and   i   0 ( { )   ?   0  for   { A h 1 @s , so   i   is eventually decreasing and we can use the Integral Test. Integration by parts gives  ]   "  1  ln   { { s   g{   = lim  w <"     { 1 3 s   [(1   3   s ) ln   {   3   1] (1   3   s ) 2   w  1  (for   s   6   = 1 )   =   1 (1   3   s ) 2  k  lim  w <"   w 1 3 s   [(1   3   s ) ln   w   3   1] + 1  l  , which exists whenever   1   3   s ?   0   C   s A   1 . Thus,   " S  q =1  ln   q q s   converges   C   s A   1 .  33.   Since this is a   s -series with   s   =   { ,    ( { )   is de fi ned when   { A   1 . Unless speci fi ed otherwise, the domain of a function   i   is the set of real numbers   {   such that the expression for   i ( { )   makes sense and de fi nes a real number. So, in the case of a series, it’s the set of real numbers   {   such that the series is convergent.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Clearly, if   s ?   0   then the series diverges, since   lim  q <"  1  q s   ln   q   =   " . If   0   $   s   $   1 , then   q s   ln   q   $   q   ln   q   i  1  q s   ln   q   D   1  q   ln   q   and   " S  q =2  1  q   ln   q   diverges (Exercise 11.3.21), so   " S  q =2  1  q s   ln   q   diverges. If   s A   1 , use the Limit Comparison Test with   d q   =   1  q s   ln   q   and   e q   =   1  q s   .   " S  q =2  e q   converges, and   lim  q <"  d q  e q  =   lim  q <"  1 ln   q   = 0 , so   " S  q =2  1  q s   ln   q   also converges. (Or use the Comparison Test, since   q s   ln   q A q s   for   q A h .) In summary, the series converges if and only if   s A   1 .  39.   Since   S   d q   converges,   lim  q <"   d q   = 0 , so there exists   Q   such that   | d q   3   0 |   ?   1   for all   q A Q   i   0   $   d q   ?   1   for all   q A Q   i   0   $   d 2  q   $   d q . Since   S   d q   converges, so does   S   d 2  q   by the Comparison Test.  40.   (a) Since   lim  q <"   ( d q @e q ) = 0 , there is a number   Q A   0   such that   | d q @e q   3   0 |   ?   1   for all   q A Q , and so   d q   ? e q   since   d q  and   e q   are positive. Thus, since   S   e q   converges, so does   S   d q   by the Comparison Test. (b)   (i) If   d q   =  ln   q q 3   and   e q   =   1  q 2   , then   lim  q <"  d q  e q  =   lim  q <"  ln   q q   =   lim  { <"  ln   { {  H  =   lim  { <"  1 @{  1   = 0 , so   " S  q =1  ln   q q 3   converges by part (a). (ii) If   d q   =   ln   q  I qh q   and   e q   =   1  h q   , then   lim  q <"  d q  e q  =   lim  q <"  ln   q  I q   =   lim  { <"  ln   {  I {  H  =   lim  { <"  1 @{  1 @ (2 I { )  =   lim  { <"  2  I {   = 0 . Now  S   e q   is a convergent geometric series with ratio   u   = 1 @h   [ | u |   ?   1] , so   S   d q   converges by part (a).  41.   (a) Since   lim  q <"  d q  e q  =   " , there is an integer   Q   such that   d q  e q  A   1   whenever   q A Q . (Take   P   = 1   in De fi nition 11.1.5.) Then   d q   A e q   whenever   q A Q   and since   S   e q   is divergent,   S   d q   is also divergent by the Comparison Test.

Let   d q   =   1  q 2   and   e q   =  1  q   . Then   lim  q <"  d q  e q  =   lim  q <"  1  q   = 0 , but   S   e q   diverges while   S   d q   converges.  43.   lim  q <"   qd q   =   lim  q <"  d q  1 @q   , so we apply the Limit Comparison Test with   e q   =  1  q   . Since   lim  q <"   qd q   A   0   we know that either both series converge or both series diverge, and we also know that   " S  q =1  1  q   diverges   [ s -series with   s   = 1 ]. Therefore,   S   d q   must be divergent.  44.   First we observe that, by l’Hospital’s Rule,   lim  { < 0  ln(1 +   { )  {   = lim  { < 0  1 1 +   {   = 1 . Also, if   S   d q   converges, then   lim  q <"   d q   = 0   by Theorem 11.2.6. Therefore,   lim  q <"  ln(1 +   d q )  d q  = lim  { < 0  ln(1 +   { )  {   = 1   A   0 . We are given that   S   d q   is convergent and   d q   A   0 . Thus,   S   ln(1 +   d q )   is convergent by the Limit Comparison Test.  45.   Yes. Since   S   d q   is a convergent series with positive terms,   lim  q <"   d q   = 0   by Theorem 11.2.6, and   S   e q   =   S   sin( d q )   is a series with positive terms (for large enough   q ). We have   lim  q <"  e q  d q  =   lim  q <"  sin( d q )  d q  = 1   A   0   by Theorem 2.4.2 [ET Theorem 3.3.2]. Thus,   S   e q   is also convergent by the Limit Comparison Test.  46.   Yes. Since   S   d q   converges, its terms approach   0   as   q   < " , so for some integer   Q ,   d q   $   1   for all   q   D   Q . But then  S "  q =1   d q e q   =   S Q   3 1  q =1   d q e q   +   S "  q = Q   d q e q   $   S Q   3 1  q =1   d q e q   +   S "  q = Q   e q . The   fi rst term is a   fi nite sum, and the second term converges since   S "  q =1   e q   converges. So   S   d q e q   converges by the Comparison Test.  11.5   Alternating Series 1.   (a) An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. (b) An alternating series   " S  q =1  d q   =   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1 e q , where   e q   =   | d q | , converges if   0   ? e q +1   $   e q   for all   q   and   lim  q <"   e q   = 0 . (This is the Alternating Series Test.) (c) The error involved in using the partial sum   v q   as an approximation to the total sum   v   is the remainder   U q   =   v   3   v q   and the size of the error is smaller than   e q +1 ; that is,   | U q |   $   e q +1 . (This is the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.)  2.   2 3   3   2 5  +  2 7   3   2 9  +   2 11   3   · · ·   =   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q +1   2 2 q   + 1   . Now   e q   =   2 2 q   + 1   A   0 ,   { e q }   is decreasing, and   lim  q <"   e q   = 0 , so the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.  3.   3   2 5  +  4 6   3   6 7  +  8 8   3   10 9   +   · · ·   =   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q   2 q q   + 4   . Now   lim  q <"   e q   =   lim  q <"  2 q q   + 4  =   lim  q <"  2 1 + 4 @q   =  2 1   6   = 0 . Since  lim  q <"   d q   6   = 0   (in fact the limit does not exist), the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Since   lim  q <"   d q   6   = 0  (in fact the limit does not exist), the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.  8.   e q   =   q  I q 3   + 2   A   0   for   q   D   1 .   { e q }   is decreasing for   q   D   2   since     {  I { 3   + 2   0  =  ( { 3   + 2) 1 @ 2 (1)   3   {   ·   1 2   ( { 3   + 2) 3 1 @ 2 (3 { 2 )   I { 3   + 2    2   =  1 2   ( { 3   + 2) 3 1 @ 2 [2( { 3   + 2)   3   3 { 3 ] ( { 3   + 2) 1   =   4   3   { 3  2( { 3   + 2) 3 @ 2   ?   0   for  { A   3  I 4   E   1 = 6 .

(That is, since the 5th term is less than the desired error, we need to add the   fi rst 4 terms to get the sum to the desired accuracy.)  26.

The   50 th partial sum of this series is an underestimate, since   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1  q   =   v 50   +     1 51   3   1 52    +     1 53   3   1 54    +   · · ·   , and the terms in parentheses are all positive. The result can be seen geometrically in Figure 1.  32.   If   s A   0 ,   1 ( q   + 1) s   $   1  q s   ( { 1 @q s }   is decreasing) and   lim  q <"  1  q s   = 0 , so the series converges by the Alternating Series Test. If   s   $   0 ,   lim  q <"  ( 3 1) q 3 1  q s   does not exist, so the series diverges by the Test for Divergence. Thus,   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1  q s  converges   C   s A   0 .  33.   Clearly   e q   =   1  q   +   s   is decreasing and eventually positive and   lim  q <"   e q   = 0   for any   s . So the series converges (by the Alternating Series Test) for any   s   for which every   e q   is de fi ned, that is,   q   +   s   6   = 0   for   q   D   1 , or   s   is not a negative integer.  34.   Let   i   ( { ) =  (ln   { ) s  {   . Then   i   0 ( { ) =  (ln   { ) s 3 1   ( s   3   ln   { )  { 2   ?   0   if   { A h s   so   i   is eventually decreasing for every   s . Clearly  lim  q <"  (ln   q ) s  q   = 0   if   s   $   0 , and if   s A   0   we can apply l’Hospital’s Rule   [[ s   + 1]]   times to get a limit of   0   as well. So the series converges for all   s   (by the Alternating Series Test).  35.   S   e 2 q   =   S   1 @ (2 q ) 2   clearly converges (by comparison with the   s -series for   s   = 2 ). So suppose that   S   ( 3 1) q 3 1   e q  converges. Then by Theorem 11.2.8(ii), so does   S  ( 3 1) q 3 1 e q   +   e q     = 2  1 +   1 3   +   1 5   +   · · ·      = 2   S   1 2 q   3   1   . But this diverges by comparison with the harmonic series, a contradiction. Therefore,   S   ( 3 1) q 3 1   e q   must diverge. The Alternating Series Test does not apply since   { e q }   is not decreasing.  36.   (a) We will prove this by induction. Let   S   ( q )   be the proposition that   v 2 q   =   k 2 q   3   k q .   S   (1)   is the statement   v 2   =   k 2   3   k 1 , which is true since   1   3   1 2   =    1 +   1 2     3   1 . So suppose that   S   ( q )   is true. We will show that   S   ( q   + 1)   must be true as a consequence.  k 2 q +2   3   k q +1   =    k 2 q   +   1 2 q   + 1  +   1 2 q   + 2    3    k q   +   1  q   + 1    = ( k 2 q   3   k q ) +   1 2 q   + 1   3   1 2 q   + 2 =   v 2 q   +   1 2 q   + 1   3   1 2 q   + 2  =   v 2 q +2  which is   S   ( q   + 1) , and proves that   v 2 q   =   k 2 q   3   k q   for all   q . (b) We know that   k 2 q   3   ln(2 q )   <      and   k q   3   ln   q   <      as   q   < " .   So  v 2 q   =   k 2 q   3   k q   = [ k 2 q   3   ln(2 q )]   3   ( k q   3   ln   q ) + [ln(2 q )   3   ln   q ] , and  lim  q <"   v 2 q   =      3      + lim  q <" [ln(2 q )   3   ln   q ] =   lim  q <"   (ln 2 + ln   q   3   ln   q ) = ln 2 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Now the ratios  u q   =   d q +1  d q  =   q 2 q  ( q   + 1)2 q +1   =   q  2( q   + 1)   form an increasing sequence, since  u q +1   3   u q   =   q   + 1 2( q   + 2)   3   q  2( q   + 1)  =  ( q   + 1) 2   3   q ( q   + 2) 2( q   + 1)( q   + 2)   =   1 2( q   + 1)( q   + 2)   A   0 . So by Exercise 34(b), the error in using   v 5   is   U 5   $   d 6  1   3   lim  q <"   u q  =  1 @  6   ·   2 6   1   3   1 @ 2   =   1 192   E   0 = 00521 . (b) The error in using   v q   as an approximation to the sum is   U q   =   d q +1  1   3   1 2  =   2 ( q   + 1)2 q +1   . We want   U q   ?   0 = 00005   C  1 ( q   + 1)2 q   ?   0 = 00005   C   ( q   + 1)2 q   A   20 , 000 . To   fi nd such an   q   we can use trial and error or a graph. We calculate  (11 + 1)2 11   = 24 , 576 , so   v 11   =   11 S  q =1  1  q 2 q   E   0 = 693109   is within   0 = 00005   of the actual sum.  40.   v 10   =   10 S  q =1  q  2 q   =  1 2  +  2 4  +  3 8  +   · · ·   +   10 1024   E   1 = 988 . The ratios   u q   =   d q +1  d q  =   q   + 1 2 q +1   ·   2 q  q   =   q   + 1 2 q   =  1 2    1 +  1  q    form a decreasing sequence, and   u 11   =  11 + 1 2(11)   =  12 22  =   6 11   ?   1 , so by Exercise 38(a), the error in using   v 10   to approximate the sum of the series   " S  q =1  q  2 q   is   U 10   $   d 11  1   3   u 11  =  11 2048  1   3   6 11  =   121 10 , 240   E   0 = 0118 .  41.   (i) Following the hint, we get that   | d q |   ? u q   for   q   D   Q , and so since the geometric series   S "  q =1   u q   converges [ 0   ? u ?   1 ], the series   S "  q = Q   | d q |   converges as well by the Comparison Test, and hence so does   S "  q =1   | d q | , so   S "  q =1   d q   is absolutely convergent. (ii) If   lim  q <"  q  s | d q |   =   O A   1 , then there is an integer   Q   such that   q  s | d q |   A   1   for all   q   D   Q , so   | d q |   A   1   for   q   D   Q . Thus,  lim  q <"   d q   6   = 0 , so   S "  q =1   d q   diverges by the Test for Divergence. (iii) Consider   " S  q =1  1  q   [diverges] and   " S  q =1  1  q 2   [converges].

(a) Since   S   d q   is absolutely convergent, and since     d +  q      $   | d q |   and     d 3  q      $   | d q |   (because   d +  q   and   d 3  q   each equal either   d q   or   0 ), we conclude by the Comparison Test that both   S   d +  q   and   S   d 3  q   must be absolutely convergent. O r:   Use Theorem 11.2.8. (b) We will show by contradiction that both   S   d +  q   and   S   d 3  q   must diverge. For suppose that   S   d +  q   converged. Then so would   S d +  q   3   1 2   d q     by Theorem 11.2.8. But   S d +  q   3   1 2   d q     =   S    1 2   ( d q   +   | d q | )   3   1 2   d q     =   1 2  S   | d q | , which diverges because   S   d q   is only conditionally convergent. Hence,   S   d +  q   can’t converge. Similarly, neither can   S   d 3  q   .  44.   Let   S   e q   be the rearranged series constructed in the hint. [This series can be constructed by virtue of the result of Exercise 43(b).] This series will have partial sums   v q   that oscillate in value back and forth across   u . Since   lim  q <"   d q   = 0  (by Theorem 11.2.6), and since the size of the oscillations   | v q   3   u |   is always less than   | d q |   because of the way   S   e q   was constructed, we have that   S   e q   =   lim  q <"   v q   =   u .  45.   Suppose that   S   d q   is conditionally convergent. (a)   S   q 2 d q   is divergent: Suppose   S   q 2 d q   converges. Then   lim  q <"   q 2 d q   = 0   by Theorem 6 in Section 11.2, so there is an integer   Q A   0   such that   q A Q   i   q 2   | d q |   ?   1 . For   q A Q , we have   | d q |   ?   1  q 2   , so   S  qAQ  | d q |   converges by comparison with the convergent   s -series   S  qAQ  1  q 2   . In other words,   S   d q   converges absolutely, contradicting the assumption that   S   d q   is conditionally convergent. This contradiction shows that   S   q 2 d q   diverges.  Remark : The same argument shows that   S   q s d q   diverges for any   s A   1 . (b)   " S  q =2  ( 3 1) q  q   ln   q   is conditionally convergent. It converges by the Alternating Series Test, but does not converge absolutely    by the Integral Test, since the function   i   ( { ) =   1  {   ln   {   is continuous, positive, and decreasing on   [2 >   " )   and  ]   "  2  g{ {   ln   {   = lim  w <"  ]   w  2  g{ {   ln   {   = lim  w <"  k  ln(ln   { )  l w  2  =   "    . Setting   d q   =  ( 3 1) q  q   ln   q   for   q   D   2 , we   fi nd that  " S  q =2  qd q   =   " S  q =2  ( 3 1) q  ln   q   converges by the Alternating Series Test. It is easy to   fi nd conditionally convergent series   S   d q   such that   S   qd q   diverges. Two examples are   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1  q   and  " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1  I q   , both of which converge by the Alternating Series Test and fail to converge absolutely because   S   | d q |   is a  s -series with   s   $   1 . In both cases,   S   qd q   diverges by the Test for Divergence.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Now   e q   =   1 cosh   q  A   0 ,   { e q }   is decreasing, and   lim  q <"   e q   = 0 , so the series converges by the Alternating Series Test.

For these   q   we have   (ln   q ) ln   q   A q 2 , so   1 (ln   q ) ln   q   ?   1  q 2   .

A power series is a series of the form   S "  q =0   f q { q   =   f 0   +   f 1 {   +   f 2 { 2   +   f 3 { 3   +   · · ·   , where   {   is a variable and the   f q ’s are constants called the coef fi cients of the series. More generally, a series of the form   S "  q =0   f q ( {   3   d ) q   =   f 0   +   f 1 ( {   3   d ) +   f 2 ( {   3   d ) 2   +   · · ·   is called a power series in  ( {   3   d )   or a power series centered at   d   or a power series about   d , where   d   is a constant.  2.   (a) Given the power series   S "  q =0   f q ( {   3   d ) q , the radius of convergence is: (i)   0   if the series converges only when   {   =   d  (ii)   "   if the series converges for all   { , or (iii) a positive number   U   such that the series converges if   | {   3   d |   ? U   and diverges if   | {   3   d |   A U . In most cases,   U   can be found by using the Ratio Test. (b) The interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all values of   {   for which the series converges. Corresponding to the cases in part (a), the interval of convergence is: (i) the single point   { d } , (ii) all real numbers; that is, the real number line   ( 3" >   " ) , or (iii) an interval with endpoints   d   3   U   and   d   +   U   which can contain neither, either, or both of the endpoints. In this case, we must test the series for convergence at each endpoint to determine the interval of convergence.  3.

By the Ratio Test, the series   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q q{ q   converges when   | { |   ?   1 , so the radius of convergence   U   = 1 .

So by Theorem 3, it must converge for at least  3 4   ? {   $   4 . In particular, it converges when   {   =   3 2 ; that is,   S "  q =0   f q ( 3 2) q   is convergent. (b) It does not follow that   S "  q =0   f q ( 3 4) q   is necessarily convergent. [See the comments after Theorem 3 about convergence at the endpoint of an interval. An example is   f q   = ( 3 1) q @ ( q 4 q ) .]  30.   We are given that the power series   S "  q =0   f q { q   is convergent for   {   =   3 4   and divergent when   {   = 6 . So by Theorem 3 it converges for at least   3 4   $   { ?   4   and diverges for at least   {   D   6   and   { ?   3 6 . Therefore: (a) It converges when   {   = 1 ; that is,   S   f q   is convergent. (b) It diverges when   {   = 8 ; that is,   S   f q 8 q   is divergent. (c) It converges when   {   =   3 3 ; that is,   S   f q ( 3 3 q )   is convergent. (d) It diverges when   {   =   3 9 ; that is,   S   f q ( 3 9) q   =   S ( 3 1) q f q 9 q   is divergent.  31.

(a) Note that the four intervals in parts (a)–(d) have midpoint   p   =   1 2   ( s   +   t )   and radius of convergence   u   =   1 2   ( t   3   s ) . We also know that the power series   " S  q =0  { q   has interval of convergence   ( 3 1 >   1) . To change the radius of convergence to   u , we can change   { q   to     { u   q  . To shift the midpoint of the interval of convergence, we can replace   {   with   {   3   p . Thus, a power series whose interval of convergence is   ( s> t )   is   " S  q =0     {   3   p u   q  , where   p   =   1 2   ( s   +   t )   and   u   =   1 2   ( t   3   s ) . (b) Similar to Example 2, we know that   " S  q =1  { q  q   has interval of convergence   [ 3 1 >   1) . By introducing the factor   ( 3 1) q  in   d q , the interval of convergence changes to   ( 3 1 >   1] . Now change the midpoint and radius as in part (a) to get  " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q   1  q     {   3   p u   q  as a power series whose interval of convergence is   ( s> t ] . (c) As in part (b),   " S  q =1  1  q     {   3   p u   q  is a power series whose interval of convergence is   [ s> t ) .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  SECTION 11.8   POWER SERIES   ¤   167  (d) If we increase the exponent on   q   (to say,   q   = 2 ), in the power series in part (c), then when   {   =   t , the power series  " S  q =1  1  q 2     {   3   p u   q  will converge by comparison to the   p -series with   s   = 2   A   1 , and the interval of convergence will be   [ s> t ] .  33.   No. If a power series is centered at   d , its interval of convergence is symmetric about   d . If a power series has an in fi nite radius of convergence, then its interval of convergence must be   ( 3" >   " ) , not   [0 >   " ) .  34.   The partial sums of the series   S "  q =0   { q   de fi nitely do not converge to   i ( { ) = 1 @ (1   3   { )   for   {   D   1 , since   i   is unde fi ned at   {   = 1   and negative on   (1 >   " ) , while all the partial sums are positive on this interval. The partial sums also fail to converge to   i   for   {   $ 3 1 , since   0   ? i   ( { )   ?   1   on this interval, while the partial sums are either larger than   1   or less than   0 . The partial sums seem to converge to   i   on   ( 3 1 >   1) . This graphical evidence is consistent with what we know about geometric series: convergence for  | { |   ?   1 , divergence for   | { |   D   1   (see Examples 1 and 5 in Section 11.2).  35.   (a) If   d q   =   ( 3 1) q   { 2 q +1  q !( q   + 1)! 2 2 q +1   , then  lim  q <"        d q +1  d q        =   lim  q <"        { 2 q +3  ( q   + 1)!( q   + 2)! 2 2 q +3   ·   q !( q   + 1)! 2 2 q +1  { 2 q +1        =     {  2   2  lim  q <"  1 ( q   + 1)( q   + 2)  = 0   for all   { . So   M 1 ( { )   converges for all   {   and its domain is   ( 3" >   " ) . (b), (c) The initial terms of   M 1 ( { )   up to   q   = 5   are   d 0   =   {  2   ,  d 1   =   3   { 3  16   ,   d 2   =   { 5  384   ,   d 3   =   3   { 7  18 , 432   ,   d 4   =   { 9  1 , 474 , 560   , and   d 5   =   3   { 11  176 , 947 , 200   . The partial sums seem to approximate   M 1 ( { )   well near the origin, but as   | { |   increases, we need to take a large number of terms to get a good approximation.  36.   (a)   D ( { ) = 1 +   " S  q =1  d q , where   d q   =   { 3 q  2   ·   3   ·   5   ·   6   · · · · ·   (3 q   3   1)(3 q )   , so   lim  q <"        d q +1  d q        =   | { | 3   lim  q <"  1 (3 q   + 2)(3 q   + 3)  = 0  for all   { , so the domain is   R .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The partial sums seem to approximate   D ( { )   well near the origin, but as   | { |   increases, we need to take a large number of terms to get a good approximation. To plot   D , we must   fi rst de fi ne   D ( { )   for the CAS. Note that for   q   D   1 , the denominator of   d q   is  2   ·   3   ·   5   ·   6   · · · · ·   (3 q   3   1)   ·   3 q   =   (3 q )! 1   ·   4   ·   7   · · · · ·   (3 q   3   2)  =   (3 q )!  T q n =1 (3 n   3   2)   , so   d q   =  T q n =1 (3 n   3   2) (3 q )!   { 3 q   and thus  D ( { ) = 1 +   " S  q =1  T q n =1 (3 n   3   2) (3 q )!   { 3 q . Both Maple and Mathematica are able to plot   D   if we de fi ne it this way, and Derive is able to produce a similar graph using a suitable partial sum of   D ( { ) . Derive, Maple and Mathematica all have two initially known Airy functions, called   AI·SERIES(z,m)   and  BI·SERIES(z,m)   from   BESSEL.MTH   in Derive and   AiryAi   and   AiryBi   in Maple and Mathematica (just   Ai   and  Bi   in older versions of Maple). However, it is very dif fi cult to solve for   D   in terms of the CAS’s Airy functions, although in fact   D ( { ) =  I 3   AiryAi ( { ) +   AiryBi ( { )  I 3   AiryAi (0) +   AiryBi (0)   .  37.   v 2 q 3 1   = 1 + 2 {   +   { 2   + 2 { 3   +   { 4   + 2 { 5   +   · · ·   +   { 2 q 3 2   + 2 { 2 q 3 1  = 1(1 + 2 { ) +   { 2 (1 + 2 { ) +   { 4 (1 + 2 { ) +   · · ·   +   { 2 q 3 2 (1 + 2 { ) = (1 + 2 { )(1 +   { 2   +   { 4   +   · · ·   +   { 2 q 3 2 ) = (1 + 2 { )  1   3   { 2 q  1   3   { 2   [by (11.2.3) with   u   =   { 2 ]   <   1 + 2 {  1   3   { 2   as   q   < "   by (11.2.4)], when   | { |   ?   1 . Also   v 2 q   =   v 2 q 3 1   +   { 2 q   <   1 + 2 {  1   3   { 2   since   { 2 q   <   0   for   | { |   ?   1 .

Thus, the interval of convergence is   ( 3 1 >   1)   and   i   ( { ) =  1 + 2 {  1   3   { 2   .  38.   v 4 q 3 1   =   f 0   +   f 1 {   +   f 2 { 2   +   f 3 { 3   +   f 0 { 4   +   f 1 { 5   +   f 2 { 6   +   f 3 { 7   +   · · ·   +   f 3 { 4 q 3 1  =    f 0   +   f 1 {   +   f 2 { 2   +   f 3 { 3   1 +   { 4   +   { 8   +   · · ·   +   { 4 q 3 4    <   f 0   +   f 1 {   +   f 2 { 2   +   f 3 { 3  1   3   { 4   as   q   < "  [by (11.2.4) with   u   =   { 4 ] for     { 4     ?   1   C   | { |   ?   1 .

So if at least one of   f 0 ,   f 1 ,   f 2 , and   f 3   is nonzero, then the interval of convergence is   ( 3 1 >   1)   and   i   ( { ) =   f 0   +   f 1 {   +   f 2 { 2   +   f 3 { 3  1   3   { 4   .  39.

If   lim  q <"        f q  f q +1        = 0  and   | {   3   d | 6   = 0 , then   ( W )   shows that   O   =   "   and so the series diverges, and hence,   U   = 0 .

Using Theorem 5 with   " S  q =0  e q ( {   3   5) q ,   e q   =   i   ( q ) ( d )  q !   , so   e 8   =   i   (8) (5) 8!   .  2.   (a) Using Equation 6, a power series expansion of   i   at   1   must have the form   i   (1) +   i   0 (1)( {   3   1) +   · · ·   . Comparing to the given series,   1 = 6   3   0 = 8( {   3   1) +   · · ·   , we must have   i 0 (1) =   3 0 = 8 . But from the graph,   i   0 (1)   is positive. Hence, the given series is   not   the Taylor series of   i   centered at   1 . (b) A power series expansion of   i   at 2 must have the form   i   (2) +   i 0 (2)( {   3   2) +   1 2   i   00 (2)( {   3   2) 2   +   · · ·   . Comparing to the given series,   2 = 8 + 0 = 5( {   3   2) + 1 = 5( {   3   2) 2   3   0 = 1( {   3   2) 3   +   · · ·   , we must have   1 2   i   00 (2) = 1 = 5 ; that is,   i   00 (2)   is positive. But from the graph,   i   is concave downward near   {   = 2 , so   i   00 (2)   must be negative. Hence, the given series is   not   the Taylor series of   i   centered at   2 .  3.   Since   i ( q ) (0) = ( q   + 1)! , Equation 7 gives the Maclaurin series  " S  q =0  i   ( q ) (0)  q !   { q   =   " S  q =0  ( q   + 1)!  q !   { q   =   " S  q =0  ( q   + 1) { q .

Since   i   ( q ) (4) =   ( 3 1) q   q ! 3 q ( q   + 1)   , Equation 6 gives the Taylor series  " S  q =0  i   ( q ) (4)  q !   ( {   3   4) q   =   " S  q =0  ( 3 1) q   q ! 3 q ( q   + 1)   q !

The limit command gives the result that   lim  { < 0   i   ( { ) = 1 .  6.   The strange results (with only 10 digits of precision) must be due to the fact that the terms being subtracted in the numerator and denominator are very close in value when   | { |   is small. Thus, the differences are imprecise (have few correct digits).  11.11   Applications of Taylor Polynomials 1.

Thus, by adding the four terms of the Maclaurin series for   h {   corresponding to   q   = 0 ,   1 ,   2 , and   3 , we can estimate   h 0 = 1   to within   0 = 00001 . (In fact, this sum is   1 = 10516   and   h 0 = 1   E   1 = 10517 .)  26.   From Table 1 in Section 11.10,   ln(1 +   { ) =   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1   { q  q   for   | { |   ?   1 . Thus,   ln 1 = 4 = ln(1 + 0 = 4) =   " S  q =1  ( 3 1) q 3 1   (0 = 4) q  q   . Since this is an alternating series, the error is less than the   fi rst neglected term by the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem, and we   fi nd that   | d 6 |   = (0 = 4) 6 @ 6   E   0 = 0007   ?   0 = 001 . So we need the   fi rst   fi ve (nonzero) terms of the Maclaurin series for the desired accuracy.

Since both the sine function and the given approximation are odd functions, we need to check the estimate only for   { A   0 .

Let   v ( w )   be the position function of the car, and for convenience set   v (0) = 0 . The velocity of the car is   y ( w ) =   v 0 ( w )   and the acceleration is   d ( w ) =   v 00 ( w ) , so the second degree Taylor polynomial is   W 2 ( w ) =   v (0) +   y (0) w   +   d (0) 2   w 2   = 20 w   +   w 2 . We estimate the distance traveled during the next second to be   v (1)   E   W 2 (1) = 20 + 1 = 21   m. The function   W 2 ( w )   would not be accurate over a full minute, since the car could not possibly maintain an acceleration of   2   m @ s 2   for that long (if it did, its   fi nal speed would be   140   m @ s   E   313   mi @ h!).  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(c) We substitute   O   = 1 ,   j   = 9 = 8 , and   n   = sin(10  @ 2)   E   0 = 08716 , and the inequality from part (b) becomes  2 = 01090   $   W   $   2 = 01093 , so   W   E   2 = 0109 . The estimate   W   E   2  s O@j   E   2 = 0071   differs by about   0 = 2% . If    0   = 42  , then   n   E   0 = 35837   and the inequality becomes   2 = 07153   $   W   $   2 = 08103 , so   W   E   2 = 0763 . The one-term estimate is the same, and the discrepancy between the two estimates increases to about   3 = 4% .  39.   Using   i   ( { ) =   W q ( { ) +   U q ( { )   with   q   = 1   and   {   =   u , we have   i   ( u ) =   W 1 ( u ) +   U 1 ( u ) , where   W 1   is the   fi rst-degree Taylor polynomial of   i   at   d . Because   d   =   { q ,   i   ( u ) =   i   ( { q ) +   i   0 ( { q )( u   3   { q ) +   U 1 ( u ) . But   u   is a root of   i   , so   i   ( u ) = 0  and we have   0 =   i ( { q ) +   i   0 ( { q )( u   3   { q ) +   U 1 ( u ) . Taking the   fi rst two terms to the left side gives us  i   0 ( { q )( { q   3   u )   3   i ( { q ) =   U 1 ( u ) . Dividing by   i 0 ( { q ) , we get   { q   3   u   3   i   ( { q )  i   0 ( { q )  =   U 1 ( u )  i 0 ( { q )   . By the formula for Newton’s method, the left side of the preceding equation is   { q +1   3   u , so   | { q +1   3   u |   =        U 1 ( u )  i   0 ( { q )      . Taylor’s Inequality gives us  | U 1 ( u ) |   $   | i   00 ( u ) |  2!   | u   3   { q | 2 . Combining this inequality with the facts   | i   00 ( { ) |   $   P   and   | i 0 ( { ) |   D   N   gives us  | { q +1   3   u |   $   P  2 N   | { q   3   u | 2 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

So if we use l’Hospital’s Rule three more times, the exponent of      in the numerator will become   0 . That is, for some   { n l } , all constant,  lim   < 0 +   i   (  )   H  =   n 1   lim   < 0 +   3 3  h e@ ( W   )  H  =   n 2   lim   < 0 +   3 2  h e@ ( W   )  H  =   n 3   lim   < 0 +   3 1  h e@ ( W   )  H  =   n 4   lim   < 0 +  1  h e@ ( W   )   = 0  2.   We expand the denominator of Planck’s Law using the Taylor series   h {   = 1 +   {   +   { 2  2!  +   { 3  3!  +   · · ·   with   {   =   kf nW   , and use the fact that if      is large, then all subsequent terms in the Taylor expansion are very small compared to the   fi rst one, so we can approximate using the Taylor polynomial   W 1 :  i   (  ) =   8 kf 3 5  h kf@ ( nW   )   3   1  =   8 kf 3 5  %  1 +   kf nW   +  1 2!     kf nW   2  +  1 3!     kf nW   3  +   · · ·  &  3   1  E   8 kf 3 5    1 +   kf nW    3   1 =  8 nW  4  which is the Rayleigh-Jeans Law.  3.   To convert to    m, we substitute   @ 10 6   for      in both laws. The   fi rst   fi gure shows that the two laws are similar for large    . The second   fi gure shows that the two laws are very different for short wavelengths (Planck’s Law gives a maximum at     E   0 = 51    m; the Rayleigh-Jeans Law gives no minimum or maximum.).  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

From the graph in Problem 3,   i   (  )   has a maximum under Planck’s Law at      E   0 = 51    m.  5.  As   W   gets larger, the total area under the curve increases, as we would expect: the hotter the star, the more energy it emits. Also, as   W   increases, the    -value of the maximum decreases, so the higher the temperature, the shorter the peak wavelength (and consequently the average wavelength) of light emitted. This is why Sirius is a blue star and Betelgeuse is a red star: most of Sirius’s light is of a fairly short wavelength; that is, a higher frequency, toward the blue end of the spectrum, whereas most of Betelgeuse’s light is of a lower frequency, toward the red end of the spectrum.  11   Review 1.

(b) A sequence is monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing. (c) By Theorem 11.1.12, every bounded, monotonic sequence is convergent.  3.   (a) See (4) in Section 11.2.

(b)   Integral Test:   Suppose   i   is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on   [1 >   " )   and let   d q   =   i   ( q ) . Then the series  S "  q =1   d q   is convergent if and only if the improper integral   U   "  1   i ( { )   g{   is convergent. In other words: (i) If   U   "  1   i   ( { )   g{   is convergent, then   S "  q =1   d q   is convergent. (ii) If   U   "  1   i   ( { )   g{   is divergent, then   S "  q =1   d q   is divergent.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The key idea is to remember that   i   ( q ) (0)   occurs in the coef fi cient of   { q   in the Maclaurin series of   i   . We start with the Maclaurin series for   sin :   sin   {   =   {   3   { 3  3!  +   { 5  5!   3   · · ·   . Then   sin( { 3 ) =   { 3   3   { 9  3!  +   { 15  5!   3   · · ·   , and so the coef fi cient of   { 15   is   i   (15) (0) 15!   =  1 5!   . Therefore,  i   (15) (0) =  15! 5!   = 6   ·   7   ·   8   ·   9   ·   10   ·   11   ·   12   ·   13   ·   14   ·   15 = 10 , 897 , 286 , 400 .  2.   We use the problem-solving strategy of taking cases:  Case (i):   If   | { |   ?   1 , then   0   $   { 2   ?   1 , so   lim  q <"   { 2 q   = 0   [see Example 11 in Section 11.1] and   i   ( { ) =   lim  q <"  { 2 q   3   1  { 2 q   + 1  =  0   3   1 0 + 1  =   3 1 . []  Case (ii):   If   | { |   = 1 , that is,   {   =   ± 1 , then   { 2   = 1 , so   i   ( { ) =   lim  q <"  { 2 q   3   1  { 2 q   + 1  =   lim  q <"  1   3   1 1 + 1  = 0 .

Thus,   i ( { ) =  ; A A A A A A A ?

Writing   v 0   and   c 0   for the number of sides and the length of the side of the initial triangle, we generate the table at right. In general, we have   v q   = 3   ·   4 q   and  c q   =      1 3   q , so the length of the perimeter at the   q th stage of construction is   s q   =   v q c q   = 3   ·   4 q   ·      1 3   q   = 3   ·      4 3   q .  v 0   = 3   c 0   = 1  v 1   = 3   ·   4   c 1   = 1 @ 3  v 2   = 3   ·   4 2   c 2   = 1 @ 3 2  v 3   = 3   ·   4 3   c 3   = 1 @ 3 3  . . .   . . . (b)   s q   =   4 q  3 q 3 1   = 4     4 3   q 3 1  . Since   4 3   A   1 ,   s q   < "   as   q   < " . (c) The area of each of the small triangles added at a given stage is one-ninth of the area of the triangle added at the preceding stage. Let   d   be the area of the original triangle. Then the area   d q   of each of the small triangles added at stage   q   is  d q   =   d   ·   1 9 q   =   d  9 q   . Since a small triangle is added to each side at every stage, it follows that the total area   D q   added to the  fi gure at the   q th stage is   D q   =   v q 3 1   ·   d q   = 3   ·   4 q 3 1   ·   d  9 q   =   d   ·   4 q 3 1  3 2 q 3 1   . Then the total area enclosed by the snow fl ake curve is   D   =   d   +   D 1   +   D 2   +   D 3   +   · · ·   =   d   +   d   ·   1 3  +   d   ·   4 3 3   +   d   ·   4 2  3 5   +   d   ·   4 3  3 7   +   · · ·   . After the   fi rst term, this is a geometric series with common ratio   4 9   , so   D   =   d   +   d@ 3 1   3   4 9  =   d   +   d  3   ·   9 5  =  8 d  5   . But the area of the original equilateral triangle with side   1   is   d   =  1 2   ·   1   ·   sin     3  =  I 3 4   . So the area enclosed by the snow fl ake curve is   8 5   ·  I 3 4   =  2   I 3 5   .  6.   Let the series   V   = 1 +   1 2   +   1 3   +   1 4   +   1 6   +   1 8   +   1 9   +   1 12   +   · · ·   . Then every term in   V   is of the form   1 2 p 3 q   ,   p ,   q   D   0 , and furthermore each term occurs only once.

The third term is less than  2 = 6   ×   10 3 13 , so by the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem, we have, to nine decimal places,  arctan   1 239   E   v 2   E   0 = 004184076 . Thus,   0 = 004184075   ?   arctan   1 239   ?   0 = 004184077 . (f ) From part (c) we have      = 16 arctan   1 5   3   4 arctan   1 239   , so from parts (d) and (e) we have  16(0 = 197395560)   3   4(0 = 004184077)   ?  ?   16(0 = 197395562)   3   4(0 = 004184075)   i  3 = 141592652   ?  ?   3 = 141592692 .

Place the   | -axis as shown and let the length of each book be   O . We want to show that the center of mass of the system of   q   books lies above the table, that is,   { ? O . The   { -coordinates of the centers of mass of the books are  { 1   =   O  2   ,   { 2   =   O  2( q   3   1)  +   O  2   ,   { 3   =   O  2( q   3   1)  +   O  2( q   3   2)  +   O  2   , and so on. Each book has the same mass   p , so if there are   q   books, then  {   =   p{ 1   +   p{ 2   +   · · ·   +   p{ q  pq   =   { 1   +   { 2   +   · · ·   +   { q  q  =  1  q     O  2  +     O  2( q   3   1)  +   O  2    +     O  2( q   3   1)  +   O  2( q   3   2)  +   O  2    +   · · ·  +     O  2( q   3   1)  +   O  2( q   3   2)  +   · · ·   +   O  4  +   O  2  +   O  2    =   O q     q   3   1 2( q   3   1)  +   q   3   2 2( q   3   2)  +   · · ·   +  2 4  +  1 2  +   q  2    =   O q    ( q   3   1)  1 2  +   q  2    =  2 q   3   1 2 q   O ?

It seems that   d q   =  1  q !   , so we try to prove this by induction. The   fi rst step is done, so assume   d n   =  1  n !   and   d n 3 1   =   1 ( n   3   1)!   .

We integrate by parts with   x   = (ln   { ) q ,   gy   =   { q   g{ , so   gx   =   q (ln   { ) q 3 1  {   g{   and   y   =   { q +1  q   + 1   :  ]   1 0  { q (ln   { ) q   g{   =   lim  w < 0 +  ]   1  w  { q (ln   { ) q   g{   =   lim  w < 0 +     { q +1  q   + 1  (ln   { ) q   1  w  3   lim  w < 0 +  ]   1  w  q q   + 1   { q (ln   { ) q 3 1   g{  = 0   3   q q   + 1  ]   1 0  { q (ln   { ) q 3 1   g{  (where l’Hospital’s Rule was used to help evaluate the   fi rst limit). Further integration by parts gives  ]   1 0  { q (ln   { ) n   g{   =   3   n q   + 1  ]   1 0  { q (ln   { ) n 3 1   g{   and, combining these steps, we get  ]   1 0  { q (ln   { ) q   g{   =  ( 3 1) q   q ! ( q   + 1) q  ]   1 0  { q   g{   =   ( 3 1) q   q ! ( q   + 1) q +1   i  ]   1 0  { {   g{   =   " S  q =0  1  q !  ]   1 0  { q (ln   { ) q   g{   =   " S  q =0  1  q ! ( 3 1) q   q !

(a) Since   S q   is de fi ned as the midpoint of   S q 3 4 S q 3 3 ,   { q   =   1 2   ( { q 3 4   +   { q 3 3 )   for   q   D   5 . So we prove by induction that  1 2   { q   +   { q +1   +   { q +2   +   { q +3   = 2 . The case   q   = 1   is immediate, since   1 2   ·   0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 . Assume that the result holds for   q   =   n   3   1 , that is,   1 2   { n 3 1   +   { n   +   { n +1   +   { n +2   = 2 . Then for   q   =   n ,  1 2   { n   +   { n +1   +   { n +2   +   { n +3   =   1 2   { n   +   { n +1   +   { n +2   +   1 2   ( { n +3 3 4   +   { n +3 3 3 )   [by above]  =   1 2   { n 3 1   +   { n   +   { n +1   +   { n +2   = 2   [by the induction hypothesis] Similarly, for   q   D   5 ,   | q   =   1 2   ( | q 3 4   +   | q 3 3 ) , so the same argument as above holds for   | , with   2   replaced by  1 2   | 1   +   | 2   +   | 3   +   | 4   =   1 2   ·   1 + 1 + 0 + 0 =   3 2   . So   1 2   | q   +   | q +1   +   | q +2   +   | q +3   =   3 2   for all   q . (b)   lim  q <"     1 2   { q   +   { q +1   +   { q +2   +   { q +3     =   1 2   lim  q <"   { q   + lim  q <"   { q +1   + lim  q <"   { q +2   + lim  q <"   { q +3   = 2 . Since all the limits on the left hand side are the same, we get   7 2   lim  q <"   { q   = 2   i   lim  q <"   { q   =   4 7   . In the same way,  7 2   lim  q <"   | q   =   3 2   i   lim  q <"   | q   =   3 7   , so   S   =      4 7   >   3 7   .  19.

Thus,  " S  q =0  1  I q   +   d 2   also diverges.

Furthermore, each term in   j q   is less than   1 10 q  1   [except for the   fi rst term in   j 1 ]. So   j q   ?   9 q   ·   1 10 q  1   = 9    9 10   q 3 1 .

So   x 0   =   z ,   y 0   =   x , and   z 0   =   y . Now differentiate the left-hand side of the desired equation:  g g{   ( x 3   +   y 3   +   z 3   3   3 xyz ) = 3 x 2 x 0   + 3 y 2 y 0   + 3 z 2 z 0   3   3( x 0 yz   +   xy 0 z   +   xyz 0 ) = 3 x 2 z   + 3 y 2 x   + 3 z 2 y   3   3( yz 2   +   x 2 z   +   xy 2 ) = 0   i  x 3   +   y 3   +   z 3   3   3 xyz   =   F . To   fi nd the value of the constant   F , we put   {   = 0   in the last equation and get  1 3   + 0 3   + 0 3   3   3(1   ·   0   ·   0) =   F   i   F   = 1 , so   x 3   +   y 3   +   z 3   3   3 xyz   = 1 .  26.   To prove:   If   q A   1 , then the   n th partial sum   v q   =   q S  l =1  1  l   of the harmonic series is not an integer.  Proof:   Let   2 n   be the largest power of   2   that is less than or equal to   q   and let   P   be the product of all the odd positive integers that are less than or equal to   q . Suppose that   v q   =   p , an integer. Then   P 2 n v q   =   P 2 n p . Since   q   D   2 , we have   n   D   1 , and hence,   P 2 n p   is an even integer. We will show that   P 2 n v q   is an odd integer, contradicting the equality   P 2 n v q   =   P 2 n p  and showing that the supposition that   v q   is an integer must have been wrong.  P 2 n v q   =   P 2 n   q S  l =1  1  l   =   q S  l =1  P 2 n  l   . If   1   $   l   $   q   and   l   is odd, then   P l   is an odd integer since   l   is one of the odd integers that were multiplied together to form   P . Thus,   P 2 n  l   is an even integer in this case. If   1   $   l   $   q   and   l   is even, then we can write   l   = 2 u   o , where   2 u   is the largest power of   2   dividing   l   and   o   is odd. If   u ? n , then   P 2 n  l   =  2 n  2 u   ·   P o   = 2 n 3 u   P o   , which is an even integer, the product of the even integer   2 n 3 u   and the odd integer   P o   . If   u   =   n , then   o   = 1 , since   o A   1 =   o   D   2   i  l   = 2 n o   D   2 n   ·   2 = 2 n +1 , contrary to the choice of   2 n   as the largest power of   2   that is less than or equal to   q . This shows that  u   =   n   only when   l   = 2 n . In that case,   P 2 n  l   =   P , an   odd   integer. Since   P 2 n  l   is an even integer for every   l   except   2 n   and  P 2 n  l   is an odd integer when   l   = 2 n , we see that   P 2 n v q   is an odd integer. This concludes the proof.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be scanned, copied, or duplicated, or posted to a publicly accessible website, in whole or in part.

First we move  4   units along the positive   { -axis, affecting only the   { -coordinate, bringing us to the point   (4 >   0 >   0) . We then move   3   units straight downward, in the negative   } -direction. Thus only the   } -coordinate is affected, and we arrive at   (4 >   0 >   3 3) .  2. 3.   The distance from a point to the   |} -plane is the absolute value of the   { -coordinate of the point.   F (2 >   4 >   6)   has the   { -coordinate with the smallest absolute value, so   F   is the point closest to the   |} -plane.   D ( 3 4 >   0 >   3 1)   must lie in the   {} -plane since the distance from   D   to the   {} -plane, given by the   | -coordinate of   D , is   0 .  4.   The projection of   (2 >   3 >   5)   onto the   {| -plane is   (2 >   3 >   0) ; onto the   |} -plane,   (0 >   3 >   5) ; onto the   {} -plane,   (2 >   0 >   5) . The length of the diagonal of the box is the distance between the origin and   (2 >   3 >   5) , given by  s (2   3   0) 2   + (3   3   0) 2   + (5   3   0) 2   =   I 38   E   6 = 16  5.   The equation   {   +   |   = 2   represents the set of all points in  R 3   whose   { - and   | -coordinates have a sum of   2 , or equivalently where   |   = 2   3   {=   This is the set  { ( {>   2   3   {> } )   |   {   M   R > }   M   R }   which is a vertical plane that intersects the   {| -plane in the line   |   = 2   3   { ,   }   = 0 .  6.   (a) In   R 2 , the equation   {   = 4   represents a line parallel to the   | -axis. In   R 3 , the equation   {   = 4   represents the set   { ( {> |> } )   |   {   = 4 } , the set of all points whose  { -coordinate is   4 . This is the vertical plane that is parallel to the   |} -plane and   4   units in front of it.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The equation   }   = 5   represents a horizontal plane parallel to the   {| -plane and   5   units above it. The pair of equations   |   = 3 ,  }   = 5   represents the set of points that are simultaneously on both planes, or in other words, the line of intersection of the planes   |   = 3 ,   }   = 5 . This line can also be described as the set   { ( {>   3 >   5)   |   {   M   R } , which is the set of all points in   R 3  whose   { -coordinate may vary but whose   | - and   } -coordinates are   fi xed at   3   and   5 , respectively. Thus the line is parallel to the   { -axis and intersects the   |} -plane in the point   (0 >   3 >   5) .  7.   We can   fi nd the lengths of the sides of the triangle by using the distance formula between pairs of vertices:  | S T |   =   s (7   3   3) 2   + [0   3   ( 3 2)] 2   + [1   3   ( 3 3)] 2   =   I 16 + 4 + 16 = 6  | TU |   =   s (1   3   7) 2   + (2   3   0) 2   + (1   3   1) 2   =   I 36 + 4 + 0 =   I 40 = 2   I 10  | US   |   =   s (3   3   1) 2   + ( 3 2   3   2) 2   + ( 3 3   3   1) 2   =   I 4 + 16 + 16 = 6  The longest side is   TU , but the Pythagorean Theorem is not satis fi ed:   | S T | 2   +   | US   | 2   6   =   | TU | 2 . Thus   S TU   is not a right triangle.   S TU   is isosceles, as two sides have the same length.  8.   Compute the lengths of the sides of the triangle by using the distance formula between pairs of vertices:  | S T |   =   s (4   3   2) 2   + [1   3   ( 3 1)] 2   + (1   3   0) 2   =   I 4 + 4 + 1 = 3  | TU |   =   s (4   3   4) 2   + ( 3 5   3   1) 2   + (4   3   1) 2   =   I 0 + 36 + 9 =   I 45 = 3   I 5  | US   |   =   s (2   3   4) 2   + [ 3 1   3   ( 3 5)] 2   + (0   3   4) 2   =   I 4 + 16 + 16 = 6  Since the Pythagorean Theorem is satis fi ed by   | S T | 2   +   | US   | 2   =   | TU | 2 ,   S TU   is a right triangle.   S TU   is not isosceles, as no two sides have the same length.  9.   (a) First we   fi nd the distances between points:  | DE |   =   s (3   3   2) 2   + (7   3   4) 2   + ( 3 2   3   2) 2   =   I 26  | EF |   =   s (1   3   3) 2   + (3   3   7) 2   + [3   3   ( 3 2)] 2   =   I 45 = 3   I 5  | DF |   =   s (1   3   2) 2   + (3   3   4) 2   + (3   3   2) 2   =   I 3  In order for the points to lie on a straight line, the sum of the two shortest distances must be equal to the longest distance. Since   I 26 +   I 3   6   = 3   I 5 , the three points do not lie on a straight line.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a) The distance from a point to the   {| -plane is the absolute value of the   } -coordinate of the point. Thus, the distance is   | 6 |   = 6 . (b) Similarly, the distance to the   |} -plane is the absolute value of the   { -coordinate of the point:   | 4 |   = 4 . (c) The distance to the   {} -plane is the absolute value of the   | -coordinate of the point:   | 3 2 |   = 2 . (d) The point on the   { -axis closest to   (4 >   3 2 >   6)   is the point   (4 >   0 >   0) . (Approach the   { -axis perpendicularly.) The distance from   (4 >   3 2 >   6)   to the   { -axis is the distance between these two points:  s (4   3   4) 2   + ( 3 2   3   0) 2   + (6   3   0) 2   =   I 40 = 2 I 10   E   6 = 32 . (e) The point on the   | -axis closest to   (4 >   3 2 >   6)   is   (0 >   3 2 >   0) . The distance between these points is  s (4   3   0) 2   + [ 3 2   3   ( 3 2)] 2   + (6   3   0) 2   =   I 52 = 2 I 13   E   7 = 21 . (f ) The point on the   } -axis closest to   (4 >   3 2 >   6)   is   (0 >   0 >   6) . The distance between these points is  s (4   3   0) 2   + ( 3 2   3   0) 2   + (6   3   6) 2   =   I 20 = 2 I 5   E   4 = 47 .  11.   An equation of the sphere with center   ( 3 3 >   2 >   5)   and radius   4   is   [ {   3   ( 3 3)] 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   5) 2   = 4 2   or  ( {   + 3) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   5) 2   = 16 . The intersection of this sphere with the   |} -plane is the set of points on the sphere whose   { -coordinate is   0 . Putting   {   = 0   into the equation, we have   9 + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   5) 2   = 16 > {   = 0   or  ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   5) 2   = 7 > {   = 0 , which represents a circle in the   |} -plane with center   (0 >   2 >   5)   and radius   I 7 .  12.   An equation of the sphere with center   (2 >   3 6 >   4)   and radius   5   is   ( {   3   2) 2   + [ |   3   ( 3 6)] 2   + ( }   3   4) 2   = 5 2   or  ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   + 6) 2   + ( }   3   4) 2   = 25 . The intersection of this sphere with the   {| -plane is the set of points on the sphere whose   } -coordinate is   0 . Putting   }   = 0   into the equation, we have   ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   + 6) 2   = 9 > }   = 0   which represents a circle in the   {| -plane with center   (2 >   3 6 >   0)   and radius   3 . To   fi nd the intersection with the   {} -plane, we set   |   = 0 :  ( {   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   4) 2   =   3 11 . Since no points satisfy this equation, the sphere does not intersect the   {} -plane. (Also note that the distance from the center of the sphere to the   {} -plane is greater than the radius of the sphere.) To   fi nd the intersection with the   |} -plane, we set   {   = 0 :   ( |   + 6) 2   + ( }   3   4) 2   = 21 > {   = 0 , a circle in the   |} -plane with center   (0 >   3 6 >   4)   and radius   I 21 .  13.   The radius of the sphere is the distance between   (4 >   3 >   3 1)   and   (3 >   8 >   1) :   u   =   s (3   3   4) 2   + (8   3   3) 2   + [1   3   ( 3 1)] 2   =   I 30 . Thus, an equation of the sphere is   ( {   3   3) 2   + ( |   3   8) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   = 30 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Completing squares in the equation   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   3   2 {   3   4 |   + 8 }   = 15   gives  ( { 2   3   2 {   + 1) + ( | 2   3   4 |   + 4) + ( } 2   + 8 }   + 16) = 15 + 1 + 4 + 16   i   ( {   3   1) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   + 4) 2   = 36 , which we recognize as an equation of a sphere with center   (1 >   2 >   3 4)   and radius   6 .  16.   Completing squares in the equation gives   ( { 2   + 8 {   + 16) + ( | 2   3   6 |   + 9) + ( } 2   + 2 }   + 1) =   3 17 + 16 + 9 + 1   i  ( {   + 4) 2   + ( |   3   3) 2   + ( }   + 1) 2   = 9 , which we recognize as an equation of a sphere with center   ( 3 4 >   3 >   3 1)   and radius   3 .  17.   Completing squares in the equation   2 { 2   3   8 {   + 2 | 2   + 2 } 2   + 24 }   = 1   gives  2( { 2   3   4 {   + 4) + 2 | 2   + 2( } 2   + 12 }   + 36) = 1 + 8 + 72   i   2( {   3   2) 2   + 2 | 2   + 2( }   + 6) 2   = 81   i  ( {   3   2) 2   +   | 2   + ( }   + 6) 2   =   81 2   , which we recognize as an equation of a sphere with center   (2 >   0 >   3 6)   and radius  t   81 2   = 9 @ I 2 .  18.   Completing squares in the equation   3 { 2   + 3 | 2   3   6 |   + 3 } 2   3   12 }   = 10   gives  3 { 2   + 3( | 2   3   2 |   + 1) + 3( } 2   3   4 }   + 4) = 10 + 3 + 12   i   3 { 2   + 3( |   3   1) 2   + 3( }   3   2) 2   = 25   i  { 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   + ( }   3   2) 2   =   25 3   , which we recognize as an equation of a sphere with center   (0 >   1 >   2)   and radius  t   25 3   = 5 @ I 3 .  19.   (a) If the midpoint of the line segment from   S 1 ( { 1 > | 1 > } 1 )   to   S 2 ( { 2 > | 2 > } 2 )   is   T   =     { 1   +   { 2  2   >  | 1   +   | 2  2   >  } 1   +   } 2  2    , then the distances   | S 1 T |   and   | TS 2 |   are equal, and each is half of   | S 1 S 2 | . We verify that this is the case:  | S 1 S 2 |   =  t  ( { 2   3   { 1 ) 2   + ( | 2   3   | 1 ) 2   + ( } 2   3   } 1 ) 2  | S 1 T |   =  t    1 2   ( { 1   +   { 2 )   3   { 1   2   +      1 2   ( | 1   +   | 2 )   3   | 1   2   +      1 2   ( } 1   +   } 2 )   3   } 1   2  =  t    1 2   { 2   3   1 2   { 1   2   +      1 2   | 2   3   1 2   | 1   2   +      1 2   } 2   3   1 2   } 1   2  =  t    1 2   2  ( { 2   3   { 1 ) 2   + ( | 2   3   | 1 ) 2   + ( } 2   3   } 1 ) 2    =   1 2  t  ( { 2   3   { 1 ) 2   + ( | 2   3   | 1 ) 2   + ( } 2   3   } 1 ) 2  =   1 2   | S 1 S 2 | | TS 2 |   =  t  { 2   3   1 2   ( { 1   +   { 2 )  2   +    | 2   3   1 2   ( | 1   +   | 2 )  2   +    } 2   3   1 2   ( } 1   +   } 2 )  2  =  t    1 2   { 2   3   1 2   { 1   2   +      1 2   | 2   3   1 2   | 1   2   +      1 2   } 2   3   1 2   } 1   2   =  t    1 2   2  ( { 2   3   { 1 ) 2   + ( | 2   3   | 1 ) 2   + ( } 2   3   } 1 ) 2   =   1 2  t  ( { 2   3   { 1 ) 2   + ( | 2   3   | 1 ) 2   + ( } 2   3   } 1 ) 2   =   1 2   | S 1 S 2 |  So   T   is indeed the midpoint of   S 1 S 2 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(Recall that a median of a triangle is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.) Then the lengths of the medians are:  | DS 2 |   =  t  0 2   +      1 2   3   2  2   + (5   3   3) 2   =  t   9 4   + 4 =  t   25 4   =   5 2  | ES 3 |   =  t    5 2   + 2  2   +      3 2   2   + (4   3   5) 2   =  t   81 4   +   9 4   + 1 =  t   94 4   =   1 2  I 94  | FS 1 |   =  t  3   1 2   3   4  2   + (1   3   1) 2   + (4   3   5) 2   =  t   81 4   + 1 =   1 2  I 85  20.   By Exercise 19(a), the midpoint of the diameter (and thus the center of the sphere) is   (3 >   2 >   7) . The radius is half the diameter, so   u   =   1 2  s (4   3   2) 2   + (3   3   1) 2   + (10   3   4) 2   =   1 2  I 44 =   I 11 . Therefore an equation of the sphere is  ( {   3   3) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   7) 2   = 11 .  21.   (a) Since the sphere touches the   {| -plane, its radius is the distance from its center,   (2 >   3 3 >   6) , to the   {| -plane, namely   6 . Therefore   u   = 6   and an equation of the sphere is   ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   + 3) 2   + ( }   3   6) 2   = 6 2   = 36 . (b) The radius of this sphere is the distance from its center   (2 >   3 3 >   6)   to the   |} -plane, which is   2 . Therefore, an equation is  ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   + 3) 2   + ( }   3   6) 2   = 4 . (c) Here the radius is the distance from the center   (2 >   3 3 >   6)   to the   {} -plane, which is   3 . Therefore, an equation is  ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   + 3) 2   + ( }   3   6) 2   = 9 .  22.   The largest sphere contained in the   fi rst octant must have a radius equal to the minimum distance from the center   (5 >   4 >   9)   to any of the three coordinate planes. The shortest such distance is to the   {} -plane, a distance of   4 . Thus an equation of the sphere is   ( {   3   5) 2   + ( |   3   4) 2   + ( }   3   9) 2   = 16 .  23.   The equation   {   = 5   represents a plane parallel to the   |} -plane and 5 units in front of it.  24.   The equation   |   =   3 2   represents a plane parallel to the   {} -plane and 2 units to the left of it.  25.   The inequality   | ?   8   represents a half-space consisting of all points to the left of the plane   |   = 8 .  26.   The inequality   {   D 3 3   represents a half-space consisting of all points on or in front of the plane   {   =   3 3 .  27.   The inequality   0   $   }   $   6   represents all points on or between the horizontal planes   }   = 0   (the   {| -plane) and   }   = 6 .  28.   The equation   } 2   = 1   C   }   =   ± 1   represents two horizontal planes;   }   = 1   is parallel to the   {| -plane, one unit above it, and   }   =   3 1   is one unit below it.  29.   Because   }   =   3 1 , all points in the region must lie in the horizontal plane   }   =   3 1 . In addition,   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 , so the region consists of all points that lie on a circle with radius   2   and center on the   } -axis that is contained in the plane   }   =   3 1 .  30.   Here   | 2   +   } 2   = 16   with no restrictions on   { , so a point in the region must lie on a circle of radius   4 , center on the   { -axis, but it could be in any vertical plane   {   =   n   (parallel to the   |} -plane). Thus the region consists of all possible circles   | 2   +   } 2   = 16 ,  {   =   n   and is therefore a circular cylinder with radius   4   whose axis is the   { -axis.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

This is the set of all points on or inside the sphere with radius   I 3   and center   (0 >   0 >   0) .  32.   The equation   {   =   }   represents a plane perpendicular to the   {} -plane and intersecting the   {} -plane in the line   {   =   } ,   |   = 0 .  33.   Here   { 2   +   } 2   $   9   or equivalently   I { 2   +   } 2   $   3   which describes the set of all points in   R 3   whose distance from the   | -axis is at most   3 . Thus, the inequality represents the region consisting of all points on or inside a circular cylinder of radius   3   with axis the   | -axis.  34.   The inequality   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   A   2 }   C   { 2   +   | 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   A   1   is equivalent to   s { 2   +   | 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   A   1 , so the region consists of those points whose distance from the point   (0 >   0 >   1)   is greater than   1 . This is the set of all points outside the sphere with radius   1   and center   (0 >   0 >   1) .  35.   This describes all points whose   { -coordinate is between 0 and 5, that is,   0   ? { ?   5 .  36.   For any point on or above the disk in the   {| -plane with center the origin and radius 2 we have   { 2   +   | 2   $   4 . Also each point lies on or between the planes   }   = 0   and   }   = 8 , so the region is described by   { 2   +   | 2   $   4 ,   0   $   }   $   8 .  37.   This describes a region all of whose points have a distance to the origin which is greater than   u , but smaller than   U . So inequalities describing the region are   u ?   s { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   ? U , or   u 2   ? { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   ? U 2 .  38.   The solid sphere itself is represented by   s { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   $   2 . Since we want only the upper hemisphere, we restrict the  } -coordinate to nonnegative values. Then inequalities describing the region are   s { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   $   2 ,   }   D   0 , or  { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   $   4 ,   }   D   0 .  39.   (a) To   fi nd the   { - and   | -coordinates of the point   S   , we project it onto   O 2  and project the resulting point   T   onto the   { - and   | -axes. To   fi nd the  } -coordinate, we project   S   onto either the   {} -plane or the   |} -plane (using our knowledge of its   { - or   | -coordinate) and then project the resulting point onto the   } -axis. (Or, we could draw a line parallel to  TR   from   S   to the   } -axis.) The coordinates of   S   are   (2 >   1 >   4) .

We need to   fi nd a set of points   S   ( {> |> } )       | DS   |   =   | ES   |   .  s ( {   + 1) 2   + ( |   3   5) 2   + ( }   3   3) 2   =   s ( {   3   6) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   + 2) 2   i  ( {   + 1) 2   + ( |   3   5) + ( }   3   3) 2   = ( {   3   6) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   + 2) 2   i  { 2   + 2 {   + 1 +   | 2   3   10 |   + 25 +   } 2   3   6 }   + 9 =   { 2   3   12 {   + 36 +   | 2   3   4 |   + 4 +   } 2   + 4 }   + 4   i   14 {   3   6 |   3   10 }   = 9 . Thus the set of points is a plane perpendicular to the line segment joining   D   and   E   (since this plane must contain the perpendicular bisector of the line segment   DE ).  42.   Completing the square three times in the   fi rst equation gives   ( {   + 2) 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   + ( }   + 2) 2   = 2 2 , a sphere with center  ( 3 2 >   1 >   2)   and radius   2 . The second equation is that of a sphere with center   (0 >   0 >   0)   and radius   2 . The distance between the centers of the spheres is   s ( 3 2   3   0) 2   + (1   3   0) 2   + ( 3 2   3   0) 2   =   I 4 + 1 + 4 = 3 . Since the spheres have the same radius, the volume inside both spheres is symmetrical about the plane containing the circle of intersection of the spheres. The distance from this plane to the center of the circles is   3 2   . So the region inside both spheres consists of two caps of spheres of height   k   = 2   3   3 2   =   1 2   . From Exercise 5.2.49 [ET 6.2.49], the volume of a cap of a sphere is  Y   =   k 2    u   3   1 3   k    =       1 2   2  2   3   1 3   ·   1 2     =   11   24   . So the total volume is   2   ·   11   24   =   11   12   .  43.   The sphere   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   = 4   has center   (0 >   0 >   0)   and radius   2 . Completing squares in   { 2   3   4 {   +   | 2   3   4 |   +   } 2   3   4 }   =   3 11  gives   ( { 2   3   4 {   + 4) + ( | 2   3   4 |   + 4) + ( } 2   3   4 }   + 4) =   3 11 + 4 + 4 + 4   i   ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   2) 2   = 1 , so this is the sphere with center   (2 >   2 >   2)   and radius   1 . The (shortest) distance between the spheres is measured along the line segment connecting their centers. The distance between   (0 >   0 >   0)   and   (2 >   2 >   2)   is  s (2   3   0) 2   + (2   3   0) 2   + (2   3   0) 2   =   I 12 = 2   I 3 , and subtracting the radius of each circle, the distance between the spheres is   2   I 3   3   2   3   1 = 2   I 3   3   3 .  44.   There are many different solids that   fi t the given description. However, any possible solid must have a circular horizontal cross-section at its top or at its base. Here we illustrate a solid with a circular base in the   {| -plane. (A circular cross-section at the top results in an inverted version of the solid described below.) The vertical cross-section through the center of the base that is parallel to the   {} -plane must be a square, and the vertical cross-section parallel to the   |} -plane (perpendicular to the square) through the center of the base must be a triangle with two vertices on the circle and the third vertex at the center of the top side of the square.

Then draw a surface formed by line segments parallel to the  |} -plane that connect the top of the square to the circle. Problem 8 in the Problems Plus section at the end of the chapter illustrates another possible solid.  12.2   Vectors 1.   (a) The cost of a theater ticket is a scalar, because it has only magnitude. (b) The current in a river is a vector, because it has both magnitude (the speed of the current) and direction at any given location. (c) If we assume that the initial path is linear, the initial   fl ight path from Houston to Dallas is a vector, because it has both magnitude (distance) and direction. (d) The population of the world is a scalar, because it has only magnitude.  2.   If the initial point of the vector   h 4 >   7 i   is placed at the origin, then  h 4 >   7 i   is the position vector of the point   (4 >   7) .  3.   Vectors are equal when they share the same length and direction (but not necessarily location). Using the symmetry of the parallelogram as a guide, we see that   3 <  DE   =   3 3 <  GF ,   3 3 <  GD   =   3 3 <  FE ,   3 3 <  GH   =   3 3 <  HE , and   3 <  HD   =   3 3 <  FH .  4.   (a) The initial point of   3 3 <  EF   is positioned at the terminal point of   3 <  DE , so by the Triangle Law the sum   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF   is the vector with initial point   D   and terminal point   F , namely   3 <  DF . (b) By the Triangle Law,   3 3 <  FG   +   3 3 <  GE   is the vector with initial point   F   and terminal point   E , namely   3 3 <  FE . (c) First we consider   3 3 <  GE   3  3 <  DE   as   3 3 <  GE   +    3 3 <  DE    . Then since   3 3 <  DE   has the same length as   3 <  DE   but points in the opposite direction, we have   3 3 <  DE   =   3 <  ED   and so   3 3 <  GE   3  3 <  DE   =   3 3 <  GE   +   3 <  ED   =   3 3 <  GD . (d) We use the Triangle Law twice:   3 3 <  GF   +   3 <  FD   +   3 <  DE   =   3 3 <  GF   +   3 <  FD    +   3 <  DE   =   3 3 <  GD   +   3 <  DE   =   3 3 <  GE .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Because the tail of   d   is the midpoint of   TU   we have   3 <  TU   = 2 d , and by the Triangle Law,  a   + 2 d   =   b   i   2 d   =   b   3   a   i   d   =   1 2   ( b   3   a ) =   1 2   b   3   1 2   a . Again by the Triangle Law we have   c   +   d   =   b   so  c   =   b   3   d   =   b   3      1 2   b   3   1 2   a    =   1 2   a   +   1 2   b .  8.   We are given   u   +   v   +   w   =   0 , so   w   = ( 3 u ) + ( 3 v ) . (See the   fi gure.) Vectors   3 u ,   3 v , and   w   form a right triangle, so from the Pythagorean Theorem we have   | 3 u | 2   +   | 3 v | 2   =   | w | 2 . But   | 3 u |   =   | u |   = 1   and   | 3 v |   =   | v |   = 1   so   | w |   =  t  | 3 u | 2   +   | 3 v | 2   =   I 2 .  9.   a   =   h 3   3   ( 3 1) >   2   3   1 i   =   h 4 >   1 i   10.   a   =   h 1   3   ( 3 4) >   2   3   ( 3 1) i   =   h 5 >   3 i  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

So   T 3   +   T 5   = 49   j . Hence  T 3   +   T 5   = ( 3   | T 3 |   cos 52    +   | T 5 |   cos 40  )   i   + ( | T 3 |   sin 52    +   | T 5 |   sin 40  )   j   = 49   j . Thus   3   | T 3 |   cos 52    +   | T 5 |   cos 40    = 0   and   | T 3 |   sin 52    +   | T 5 |   sin 40    = 49 . From the   fi rst of these two equations   | T 3 |   =   | T 5 |   cos 40   cos 52    . Substituting this into the second equation gives  | T 5 |   =   49 cos 40    tan 52    + sin 40    E   30   N. Therefore,   | T 3 |   =   | T 5 |   cos 40   cos 52    E   38 N .

By similar triangles,   e d   =  0 = 08 4   i   d   = 50 e . The force due to gravity acting on the shirt has magnitude   0 = 8 j   E   (0 = 8)(9 = 8) = 7 = 84   N, hence we have   w   =   3 7 = 84   j . The resultant   T 1   +   T 2  of the tensile forces counterbalances   w , so   T 1   +   T 2   =   3 w   i   ( 3 d   i   +   e   j ) + ( d   i   +   e   j ) = 7 = 84   j   i  ( 3 50 e   i   +   e   j ) + (50 e   i   +   e   j ) = 2 e   j   = 7 = 84   j   i   e   =   7 = 84 2   = 3 = 92   and   d   = 50 e   = 196 . Thus the tensions are  T 1   =   3 d   i   +   e   j   =   3 196   i   + 3 = 92   j   and   T 2   =   d   i   +   e   j   = 196   i   + 3 = 92   j . Alternatively, we can   fi nd the value of      and proceed as in Example 7.  38.   We can consider the weight of the chain to be concentrated at its midpoint. The forces acting on the chain then are the tension vectors   T 1 ,   T 2   in each end of the chain and the weight   w , as shown in the   fi gure. We know   | T 1 |   =   | T 2 |   = 25   N so, in terms of vertical and horizontal components, we have  T 1   =   3 25 cos 37  i   + 25 sin 37  j T 2   = 25 cos 37  i   + 25 sin 37  j  The resultant vector   T 1   +   T 2   of the tensions counterbalances the weight   w >   giving   T 1   +   T 2   =   3 w =   Since   w   =   3   | w |   j , we have   ( 3 25 cos 37  i   + 25 sin 37  j ) + (25 cos 37  i   + 25 sin 37  j ) =   | w |   j   i   50 sin 37  j   =   | w |   j   i  | w |   = 50 sin 37    E   30 = 1 . So the weight is   30 = 1 N , and since   z   =   pj , the mass is   30 = 1 9 = 8   E   3 = 07 kg .  39.   (a) Set up coordinate axes so that the boatman is at the origin, the canal is bordered by the   | -axis and the line   {   = 3 , and the current   fl ows in the negative   | -direction. The boatman wants to reach the point   (3 >   2) . Let      be the angle, measured from the positive   | -axis, in the direction he should steer. (See the   fi gure.)  In still water, the boat has velocity   v e   =   h 13 sin   >   13 cos    i   and the velocity of the current is   v f   h 0 >   3 3 = 5 i , so the true path of the boat is determined by the velocity vector   v   =   v e   +   v f   =   h 13 sin   >   13 cos      3   3 = 5 i . Let   w   be the time (in hours) after the boat departs; then the position of the boat at time   w   is given by   w v   and the boat crosses the canal when  w v   =   h 13 sin   >   13 cos      3   3 = 5 i   w   =   h 3 >   2 i . Thus   13(sin    ) w   = 3   i   w   =   3 13 sin      and   (13 cos      3   3 = 5)   w   = 2 . Substituting gives   (13 cos      3   3 = 5)   3 13 sin      = 2   i   39 cos      3   10 = 5 = 26 sin      ( 1 ). Squaring both sides, we have  1521 cos 2      3   819 cos      + 110 = 25 = 676 sin 2      = 676    1   3   cos 2      2197 cos 2      3   819 cos      3   565 = 75 = 0  The quadratic formula gives  cos      =  819   ±   s ( 3 819) 2   3   4(2197)( 3 565 = 75) 2(2197) =  819   ±   I 5 , 642 , 572 4394   E   0 = 72699   or   3   0 = 35421  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Thus the boatman should steer in the direction that is  43 = 4    from the bank, toward upstream.  Alternate solution:   We could solve ( 1 ) graphically by plotting   |   = 39 cos      3   10 = 5   and   |   = 26 sin      on a graphing device and   fi nding the appoximate intersection point   (0 = 757 >   17 = 85) . Thus      E   0 = 757   radians or equivalently   43 = 4  . (b) From part (a) we know the trip is completed when   w   =   3 13 sin      . But      E   43 = 4  , so the time required is approximately  3 13 sin 43 = 4    E   0 = 336   hours or   20 = 2   minutes.  40.   Let   v 1 ,   v 2 , and   v 3   be the force vectors where   | v 1 |   = 25 ,   | v 2 |   = 12 , and   | v 3 |   = 4 . Set up coordinate axes so that the object is at the origin and   v 1 ,   v 2   lie in the   {| -plane. We can position the vectors so that   v 1   = 25   i ,   v 2   = 12 cos 100    i   + 12 sin 100    j , and   v 3   = 4   k . The magnitude of a force that counterbalances the three given forces must match the magnitude of the resultant force. We have   v 1   +   v 2   +   v 3   = (25 + 12 cos 100  )   i   + 12 sin 100    j   + 4   k , so the counterbalancing force must have magnitude   | v 1   +   v 2   +   v 3 |   =   s (25 + 12 cos 100  ) 2   + (12 sin 100  ) 2   + 4 2   E   26 = 1   N.  41.

(b) The slope of the tangent line is   I 3 , so the slope of a line perpendicular to the tangent line is   3   1 I 3   and a vector in this direction is   I 3   i   3   j . Since     I 3   i   3   j     =  t  I 3    2   + ( 3 1) 2   = 2 , unit vectors perpendicular to the tangent line are   ±   1 2   I 3   i   3   j  . (c)  43.   By the Triangle Law,   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF   =   3 <  DF . Then   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF   +   3 <  FD   =   3 <  DF   +   3 <  FD , but   3 <  DF   +   3 <  FD   =   3 <  DF   +    3 3 <  DF    =   0 . So   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF   +   3 <  FD   =   0 .  44.   3 <  DF   =   1 3  3 <  DE   and   3 3 <  EF   =   2 3  3 <  ED .   c   =   3 <  RD   +   3 <  DF   =   a   +   1 3  3 <  DE   i   3 <  DE   = 3   c   3   3   a .   c   =   3 3 <  RE   +   3 3 <  EF   =   3 <  RD   +   2 3  3 <  ED   i 3 <  ED   =   3 2   c   3   3 2   b .   3 <  ED   =   3 3 <  DE , so   3 2   c   3   3 2   b   = 3   a   3   3   c   C   c   + 2   c   = 2   a   +   b   C   c   =   2 3   a   +   1 3   b .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(d)   c   =   v   a   +   w   b   C   7 = 3 v   + 2 w   and   1 = 2 v   3   w . Solving these equations gives   v   =   9 7   and   w   =   11 7   .  46.   Draw   a ,   b , and   c   emanating from the origin. Extend   a   and   b   to form lines   D  and   E , and draw lines   D 0   and   E 0   parallel to these two lines through the terminal point of   c . Since   a   and   b   are not parallel,   D   and   E 0   must meet (at   S   ), and   D 0  and   E   must also meet (at   T ). Now we see that   3 3 <  RS   +   3 3 <  RT   =   c , so if  v   =     3 3 <  RS      | a |    or its negative, if   a   points in the direction opposite   3 3 <  RS    and   w   =     3 3 <  RT      | b |   (or its negative, as in the diagram), then   c   =   v a   +   w b , as required.  Argument using components:   Since   a ,   b , and   c   all lie in the same plane, we can consider them to be vectors in two dimensions. Let   a   =   h d 1 > d 2 i ,   b   =   h e 1 > e 2 i , and   c   =   h f 1 > f 2 i . We need   vd 1   +   we 1   =   f 1   and   vd 2   +   we 2   =   f 2 . Multiplying the   fi rst equation by   d 2   and the second by   d 1   and subtracting, we get   w   =   f 2 d 1   3   f 1 d 2  e 2 d 1   3   e 1 d 2  . Similarly   v   =   e 2 f 1   3   e 1 f 2  e 2 d 1   3   e 1 d 2  . Since   a   6   =   0   and   b   6   =   0   and   a   is not a scalar multiple of   b , the denominator is not zero.  47.   | r   3   r 0 |   is the distance between the points   ( {> |> } )   and   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) , so the set of points is a sphere with radius   1   and center   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) .  Alternate method:   | r   3   r 0 |   = 1   C   s ( {   3   { 0 ) 2   + ( |   3   | 0 ) 2   + ( }   3   } 0 ) 2   = 1   C  ( {   3   { 0 ) 2   + ( |   3   | 0 ) 2   + ( }   3   } 0 ) 2   = 1 , which is the equation of a sphere with radius   1   and center   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) .  48.   Let   S 1   and   S 2   be the points with position vectors   r 1   and   r 2   respectively. Then   | r   3   r 1 |   +   | r   3   r 2 |   is the sum of the distances from   ( {> | )   to   S 1   and   S 2 . Since this sum is constant, the set of points   ( {> | )   represents an ellipse with foci   S 1   and   S 2 . The condition   n A   | r 1   3   r 2 |   assures us that the ellipse is not degenerate.  49.   a   + ( b   +   c ) =   h d 1 > d 2 i   + ( h e 1 > e 2 i   +   h f 1 > f 2 i ) =   h d 1 > d 2 i   +   h e 1   +   f 1 > e 2   +   f 2 i  =   h d 1   +   e 1   +   f 1 > d 2   +   e 2   +   f 2 i   =   h ( d 1   +   e 1 ) +   f 1 >   ( d 2   +   e 2 ) +   f 2 i  =   h d 1   +   e 1 > d 2   +   e 2 i   +   h f 1 > f 2 i   = ( h d 1 > d 2 i   +   h e 1 > e 2 i ) +   h f 1 > f 2 i  = ( a   +   b ) +   c  50.   Algebraically:  f ( a   +   b ) =   f   ( h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i   +   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i ) =   f   h d 1   +   e 1 > d 2   +   e 2 > d 3   +   e 3 i  =   h f   ( d 1   +   e 1 )   > f   ( d 2   +   e 2 )   > f   ( d 3   +   e 3 ) i   =   h fd 1   +   fe 1 > fd 2   +   fe 2 > fd 3   +   fe 3 i  =   h fd 1 > fd 2 > fd 3 i   +   h fe 1 > fe 2 > fe 3 i   =   f   a   +   f   b  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Construct triangle   S VW   as shown so that   3 <  S V   =   f   a   and  3 <  VW   =   f   b . (We have drawn the case where   f A   1 .) By the Triangle Law,  3 <  S W   =   f   a   +   f   b . But triangle   S TU   and triangle   S VW   are similar triangles because   f   b   is parallel to   b . Therefore,   3 <  SU   and   3 <  S W   are parallel and, in fact,  3 <  S W   =   f 3 <  SU . Thus,   f   a   +   f   b   =   f ( a   +   b ) .  51.   Consider triangle   DEF , where   G   and   H   are the midpoints of   DE   and   EF . We know that   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF   =   3 <  DF   ( 1 )   and  3 3 <  GE   +   3 3 <  EH   =   3 3 <  GH   ( 2 ).   However,   3 3 <  GE   =   1 2  3 <  DE , and   3 3 <  EH   =   1 2  3 3 <  EF . Substituting these expressions for   3 3 <  GE   and   3 3 <  EH   into ( 2 ) gives   1 2  3 <  DE   +   1 2  3 3 <  EF   =   3 3 <  GH . Comparing this with ( 1 ) gives   3 3 <  GH   =   1 2  3 <  DF . Therefore   3 <  DF   and   3 3 <  GH   are parallel and     3 3 <  GH       =   1 2     3 <  DF     .  52.   The question states that the light ray strikes all three mirrors, so it is not parallel to any of them and   d 1   6   = 0 ,   d 2   6   = 0   and  d 3   6   = 0 . Let   b   =   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i , as in the diagram. We can let   | b |   =   | a | , since only its direction is important. Then  | e 2 | | b |   = sin      =   | d 2 | | a |   i   | e 2 |   =   | d 2 | . From the diagram   e 2   j   and   d 2   j   point in opposite directions, so   e 2   =   3 d 2 .   | DE |   =   | EF | , so  | e 3 |   = sin   !   | EF |   = sin   !   | DE |   =   | d 3 | , and  | e 1 |   = cos   !   | EF |   = cos   !   | DE |   =   | d 1 | .  e 3   k   and   d 3   k   have the same direction, as do   e 1   i   and   d 1   i , so  b   =   h d 1 >   3 d 2 > d 3 i . When the ray hits the other mirrors, similar arguments show that these re fl ections will reverse the signs of the other two coordinates, so the   fi nal re fl ected ray will be  h 3 d 1 >   3 d 2 >   3 d 3 i   =   3 a , which is parallel to   a .  12.3   The Dot Product 1.   (a)   a   ·   b   is a scalar, and the dot product is de fi ned only for vectors, so   ( a   ·   b )   ·   c   has no meaning. (b)   ( a   ·   b )   c   is a scalar multiple of a vector, so it does have meaning. (c) Both   | a |   and   b   ·   c   are scalars, so   | a |   ( b   ·   c )   is an ordinary product of real numbers, and has meaning.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus the angle between   u   and   v   is   60    and  u   ·   v   =   | u | | v |   cos 60    = (1)(1)    1 2     =   1 2   =   If   w   is moved so it has the same initial point as   u , we can see that the angle between them is   120    and we have   u   ·   w   =   | u | | w |   cos 120    = (1)(1)  3   1 2     =   3   1 2   .  12.   u   is a unit vector, so   w   is also a unit vector, and   | v |   can be determined by examining the right triangle formed by   u   and   v =  Since the angle between   u   and   v   is   45  , we have   | v |   =   | u |   cos 45    =   I 2 2   .

Similarly,   j   ·   k   = (0)(0) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) = 0   and  k   ·   i   = (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) = 0 .  Another method:   Because   i ,   j , and   k   are mutually perpendicular, the cosine factor in each dot product (see Theorem 3) is   cos     2   = 0 . (b) By Property 1 of the dot product,   i   ·   i   =   | i | 2   = 1 2   = 1   since   i   is a unit vector. Similarly,   j   ·   j   =   | j | 2   = 1   and  k   ·   k   =   | k | 2   = 1 .  14.   The dot product   A   ·   P   is  h d> e> f i · h 2 >   1 = 5 >   1 i   =   d (2) +   e (1 = 5) +   f (1) = ( number of hamburgers sold )( price per hamburger ) + ( number of hot dogs sold )( price per hot dog ) + ( number of soft drinks sold )( price per soft drink )  so it is equal to the vendor’s total revenue for that day.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Let   S 2   = ( { 2 > | 2 )   lie on the line.

From the diagram (in which   D ,   E   and   U   are the terminal points of the vectors), we see that this implies that   U   lies on a sphere whose diameter is the line from  D   to   E .

Consider a cube with sides of unit length, wholly within the   fi rst octant and with edges along each of the three coordinate axes.  i   +   j   +   k   and   i   +   j   are vector representations of a diagonal of the cube and a diagonal of one of its faces. If      is the angle between these diagonals, then   cos      =  ( i   +   j   +   k )   ·   ( i   +   j )  | i   +   j   +   k | | i   +   j |   =   1 + 1  I 3   I 2  =  u   2 3   i      = cos 3 1  t   2 3   E   35  .  57.   Consider the H — C — H combination consisting of the sole carbon atom and the two hydrogen atoms that are at   (1 >   0 >   0)   and  (0 >   1 >   0)   (or any H — C — H combination, for that matter). Vector representations of the line segments emanating from the carbon atom and extending to these two hydrogen atoms are   1   3   1 2   >   0   3   1 2   >   0   3   1 2     =   1 2   >   3   1 2   >   3   1 2     and  0   3   1 2   >   1   3   1 2   >   0   3   1 2     =   3   1 2   >   1 2   >   3   1 2   . The bond angle,    , is therefore given by  cos      =  1 2   >   3   1 2   >   3   1 2     ·   3   1 2   >   1 2   >   3   1 2       1 2   >   3   1 2   >   3   1 2         3   1 2   >   1 2   >   3   1 2      =   3   1 4   3   1 4   +   1 4  t   3 4  t   3 4  =   3   1 3   i      = cos 3 1  3   1 3     E   109 = 5  .  58.   Let      be the angle between   a   and   c   and      be the angle between   c   and   b . We need to show that      =    . Now  cos      =   a   ·   c  | a | | c |   =   a   · | a |   b   +   a   · | b |   a  | a | | c |   =   | a |   a   ·   b   +   | a | 2   | b | | a | | c |   =   a   ·   b   +   | a | | b | | c |   . Similarly,  cos      =   b   ·   c  | b | | c |   =   | a | | b |   +   b   ·   a  | c |   . Thus   cos      = cos    . However   0    $      $   180    and   0    $      $   180  , so      =      and  c   bisects the angle between   a   and   b .  59.   Let   a   =   h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i   and   =   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i . Property 2:   a   ·   b   =   h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i · h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i   =   d 1 e 1   +   d 2 e 2   +   d 3 e 3  =   e 1 d 1   +   e 2 d 2   +   e 3 d 3   =   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i · h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i   =   b   ·   a  Property 4:   ( f   a )   ·   b   =   h fd 1 > fd 2 > fd 3 i · h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i   = ( fd 1 ) e 1   + ( fd 2 ) e 2   + ( fd 3 ) e 3  =   f   ( d 1 e 1   +   d 2 e 2   +   d 3 e 3 ) =   f   ( a   ·   b ) =   d 1 ( fe 1 ) +   d 2 ( fe 2 ) +   d 3 ( fe 3 ) =   h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i · h fe 1 > fe 2 > fe 3 i   =   a   ·   ( f   b )  Property 5:   0   ·   a   =   h 0 >   0 >   0 i · h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i   = (0)( d 1 ) + (0)( d 2 ) + (0)( d 3 ) = 0  60.   Let the   fi gure be called quadrilateral   DEFG . The diagonals can be represented by   3 <  DF   and   3 3 <  EG .   3 <  DF   =   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF   and  3 3 <  EG   =   3 3 <  EF   +   3 3 <  FG   =   3 3 <  EF   3  3 3 <  GF   =   3 3 <  EF   3  3 <  DE   (Since opposite sides of the object are of the same length and parallel,  3 <  DE   =   3 3 <  GF .) Thus  3 <  DF   ·   3 3 <  EG   =   3 <  DE   +   3 3 <  EF    ·   3 3 <  EF   3  3 <  DE    =   3 <  DE   ·   3 3 <  EF   3  3 <  DE    +   3 3 <  EF   ·   3 3 <  EF   3  3 <  DE    =   3 <  DE   ·   3 3 <  EF   3     3 <  DE     2  +     3 3 <  EF     2  3  3 <  DE   ·   3 3 <  EF   =     3 3 <  EF     2  3     3 <  DE     2  But     3 <  DE     2  =     3 3 <  EF     2  because all sides of the quadrilateral are equal in length. Therefore   3 <  DF   ·   3 3 <  EG   = 0 , and since both of these vectors are nonzero this tells us that the diagonals of the quadrilateral are perpendicular.  61.   | a   ·   b |   =       | a | | b |   cos        =   | a | | b | | cos    | . Since   | cos    |   $   1 ,   | a   ·   b |   =   | a | | b | | cos    |   $   | a | | b | .  Note:   We have equality in the case of   cos      =   ± 1 , so      = 0   or      =    , thus equality when   a   and   b   are parallel.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a)   The Triangle Inequality states that the length of the longest side of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides. (b)   | a   +   b | 2   = ( a   +   b )   ·   ( a   +   b ) = ( a   ·   a ) + 2( a   ·   b ) + ( b   ·   b ) =   | a | 2   + 2( a   ·   b ) +   | b | 2  $   | a | 2   + 2   | a | | b |   +   | b | 2   [by the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality]  = ( | a |   +   | b | ) 2  Thus, taking the square root of both sides,   | a   +   b |   $   | a |   +   | b | .  63.   (a)   The Parallelogram Law states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares of its (four) sides. (b)   | a   +   b | 2   = ( a   +   b )   ·   ( a   +   b ) =   | a | 2   + 2( a   ·   b ) +   | b | 2   and   | a   3   b | 2   = ( a   3   b )   ·   ( a   3   b ) =   | a | 2   3   2( a   ·   b ) +   | b | 2 . Adding these two equations gives   | a   +   b | 2   +   | a   3   b | 2   = 2   | a | 2   + 2   | b | 2 .  64.   If the vectors   u   +   v   and   u   3   v   are orthogonal then   ( u   +   v )   ·   ( u   3   v ) = 0 . But  ( u   +   v )   ·   ( u   3   v ) = ( u   +   v )   ·   u   3   ( u   +   v )   ·   v   by Property 3 of the dot product  =   u   ·   u   +   v   ·   u   3   u   ·   v   3   v   ·   v   by Property 3  =   | u | 2   +   u   ·   v   3   u   ·   v   3   | v | 2   by Properties 1 and 2  =   | u | 2   3   | v | 2  Thus   | u | 2   3   | v | 2   = 0   i   | u | 2   =   | v | 2   i   | u |   =   | v |   [since   | u | ,   | v |   D   0 ].  12.4   The Cross Product 1.   a   ×   b   =          i   j   k  6   0   3 2 0   8   0          =        0   3 2 8   0         i   3        6   3 2 0   0         j   +        6   0 0   8         k  = [0   3   ( 3 16)]   i   3   (0   3   0)   j   + (48   3   0)   k   = 16   i   + 48   k  Now   ( a   ×   b )   ·   a   =   h 16 >   0 >   48 i · h 6 >   0 >   3 2 i   = 96 + 0   3   96 = 0   and   ( a   ×   b )   ·   b   =   h 16 >   0 >   48 i · h 0 >   8 >   0 i   = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 , so  a   ×   b   is orthogonal to both   a   and   b .  2.   a   ×   b   =          i   j   k  1   1   3 1 2   4   6          =        1   3 1 4   6         i   3        1   3 1 2   6         j   +        1   1 2   4         k  = [6   3   ( 3 4)]   i   3   [6   3   ( 3 2)]   j   + (4   3   2)   k   = 10   i   3   8   j   + 2   k  Now   ( a   ×   b )   ·   a   =   h 10 >   3 8 >   2 i · h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i   = 1 0 3   8   3   2 = 0   and   ( a   ×   b )   ·   b   =   h 10 >   3 8 >   2 i · h 2 >   4 >   6 i   = 20   3   32 + 12 = 0 , so   a   ×   b   is orthogonal to both   a   and   b .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The parallelogram is determined by the vectors   3 3 <  NO   =   h 0 >   1 >   3 i   and   3 3 <  NQ   =   h 2 >   5 >   0 i , so the area of parallelogram   NOPQ   is     3 3 <  NO   ×   3 3 <  NQ       =                  i   j   k  0   1   3 2   5   0                  =   | ( 3 15)   i   3   ( 3 6)   j   + ( 3 2)   k |   =   | 3 15   i   + 6   j   3   2   k |   =   I 265   E   16 = 28  29.   (a) Because the plane through   S   ,   T , and   U   contains the vectors   3 3 <  S T   and   3 <  S U , a vector orthogonal to both of these vectors (such as their cross product) is also orthogonal to the plane. Here   3 3 <  S T   =   h 3 3 >   1 >   2 i   and   3 <  S U   =   h 3 >   2 >   4 i , so  3 3 <  S T   ×   3 <  S U   =   h (1)(4)   3   (2)(2) >   (2)(3)   3   ( 3 3)(4) >   ( 3 3)(2)   3   (1)(3) i   =   h 0 >   18 >   3 9 i  Therefore,   h 0 >   18 >   3 9 i   (or any nonzero scalar multiple thereof, such as   h 0 >   2 >   3 1 i ) is orthogonal to the plane through   S   ,   T , and   U . (b) Note that the area of the triangle determined by   S   ,   T , and   U   is equal to half of the area of the parallelogram determined by the three points. From part (a), the area of the parallelogram is       3 3 <  S T   ×   3 <  S U       =   |h 0 >   18 >   3 9 i|   =   I 0 + 324 + 81 =   I 405 = 9 I 5 , so the area of the triangle is   1 2   ·   9 I 5 =   9 2  I 5 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

By Equation 14, the volume of the parallelepiped determined by   a ,   b , and   c   is the magnitude of their scalar triple product, which is   a   ·   ( b   ×   c ) =          1   2   3  3 1   1   2 2   1   4          = 1        1   2 1   4         3   2        3 1   2 2   4         + 3        3 1   1 2   1         = 1(4   3   2)   3   2( 3 4   3   4) + 3( 3 1   3   2) = 9 .

As   u   rotates counterclockwise,   u   ×   v   is directed in the negative   } -direction (by the right-hand rule) and the length increases until      =     2   , in which case   u   =   3 3   i   and  | u   ×   v |   = 15 .

From ( 3 ) we have   y 2   = 2 y 1   3   5   and from ( 2 ) we have   y 3   =   y 1   3   1 ; substitution into ( 1 ) gives  2 ( y 1   3   1)   3   (2 y 1   3   5) = 3   i   3 = 3 , so this is a dependent system. If we let   y 1   =   d   then   y 2   = 2 d   3   5   and  y 3   =   d   3   1 , so   v   is any vector of the form   h d>   2 d   3   5 > d   3   1 i .

Alternatively, if we use matrices to solve the system we could show that the determinant is 0 (and hence the system has no solution).  45.

Thus by Theorem 9,   sin      =   | a   ×   b | | a | | b |  and so   g   =   | b |   sin      =   | b | | a   ×   b | | a | | b |   =   | a   ×   b | | a |   .

Since   a   ·   c   =   a   ·   b ,   a   is perpendicular to   b   3   c , by part (a). From part (b),   a   is also parallel to   b   3   c . Thus since  a   6   =   0   but is both parallel and perpendicular to   b   3   c , we have   b   3   c   =   0 , so   b   =   c .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus we have  v 4   ·   v 4   =   v 1   ·   v 1   +   v 2   ·   v 2   +   v 3   ·   v 3   i   | v 4 | 2   =   | v 1 | 2   +   | v 2 | 2   +   | v 3 | 2   i   G 2   =   D 2   +   E 2   +   F 2 .  Another method:   We introduce a coordinate system, as shown. Recall that the area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors is equal to the length of their cross product, so since  u   ×   v   =   h 3 t> u>   0 i × h 3 t>   0 > s i   =   h su> st> tu i , we have  | u   ×   v |   =   s ( su ) 2   + ( st ) 2   + ( tu ) 2 , and therefore  G 2   =      1 2   | u   ×   v |  2   =   1 4   [( su ) 2   + ( st ) 2   + ( tu ) 2 ] =      1 2   su  2   +      1 2   st  2   +      1 2   tu  2   =   D 2   +   E 2   +   F 2 .  A third method:   We draw a line from   V   perpendicular to   TU , as shown. Now   G   =   1 2   fk , so   G 2   =   1 4   f 2 k 2 . Substituting   k 2   =   s 2   +   n 2 , we get  G 2   =   1 4   f 2  s 2   +   n 2    =   1 4   f 2 s 2   +   1 4   f 2 n 2 . But   F   =   1 2   fn , so  G 2   =   1 4   f 2 s 2   +   F 2 . Now substituting   f 2   =   t 2   +   u 2   gives  G 2   =   1 4   s 2 t 2   +   1 4   t 2 u 2   +   F 2   =   D 2   +   E 2   +   F 2 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a) True; each of the   fi rst two lines has a direction vector parallel to the direction vector of the third line, so these vectors are each scalar multiples of the third direction vector. Then the   fi rst two direction vectors are also scalar multiples of each other, so these vectors, and hence the two lines, are parallel. (b) False; for example, the   { - and   | -axes are both perpendicular to the   } -axis, yet the   { - and   | -axes are not parallel. (c) True; each of the   fi rst two planes has a normal vector parallel to the normal vector of the third plane, so these two normal vectors are parallel to each other and the planes are parallel. (d) False; for example, the   {| - and   |} -planes are not parallel, yet they are both perpendicular to the   {} -plane. (e) False; the   { - and   | -axes are not parallel, yet they are both parallel to the plane   }   = 1 . (f ) True; if each line is perpendicular to a plane, then the lines’ direction vectors are both parallel to a normal vector for the plane. Thus, the direction vectors are parallel to each other and the lines are parallel. (g) False; the planes   |   = 1   and   }   = 1   are not parallel, yet they are both parallel to the   { -axis. (h) True; if each plane is perpendicular to a line, then any normal vector for each plane is parallel to a direction vector for the line. Thus, the normal vectors are parallel to each other and the planes are parallel. (i) True; see Figure 9 and the accompanying discussion. ( j) False; they can be skew, as in Example 3. (k) True. Consider any normal vector for the plane and any direction vector for the line. If the normal vector is perpendicular to the direction vector, the line and plane are parallel. Otherwise, the vectors meet at an angle    ,   0    $    ?   90  , and the line will intersect the plane at an angle   90    3    .  2.   For this line, we have   r 0   = 6   i   3   5   j   + 2   k   and   v   =   i   + 3   j   3   2 3   k , so a vector equation is  r   =   r 0   +   w   v   = (6   i   3   5   j   + 2   k ) +   w  i   + 3   j   3   2 3   k    = (6 +   w )   i   + ( 3 5 + 3 w )   j   +    2   3   2 3   w    k   and parametric equations are  {   = 6 +   w ,   |   =   3 5 + 3 w ,   }   = 2   3   2 3   w .  3.   For this line, we have   r 0   = 2   i   + 2 = 4   j   + 3 = 5   k   and   v   = 3   i   + 2   j   3   k , so a vector equation is  r   =   r 0   +   w   v   = (2   i   + 2 = 4   j   + 3 = 5   k ) +   w (3   i   + 2   j   3   k ) = (2 + 3 w )   i   + (2 = 4 + 2 w )   j   + (3 = 5   3   w )   k   and parametric equations are  {   = 2 + 3 w ,   |   = 2 = 4 + 2 w ,   }   = 3 = 5   3   w .  4.   This line has the same direction as the given line,   v   = 2   i   3   3   j   + 9   k . Here   r 0   = 14   j   3   10   k , so a vector equation is  r   = (14   j   3   10   k ) +   w (2   i   3   3   j   + 9   k ) = 2 w   i   + (14   3   3 w )   j   + ( 3 10 + 9 w )   k   and parametric equations are   {   = 2 w ,  |   = 14   3   3 w ,   }   =   3 10 + 9 w .  5.   A line perpendicular to the given plane has the same direction as a normal vector to the plane, such as  n   =   h 1 >   3 >   1 i . So   r 0   =   i   + 6   k , and we can take   v   =   i   + 3   j   +   k . Then a vector equation is  r   = ( i   + 6   k ) +   w ( i   + 3   j   +   k ) = (1 +   w )   i   + 3 w   j   + (6 +   w )   k , and parametric equations are   {   = 1 +   w ,   |   = 3 w ,   }   = 6 +   w .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Notice here that the direction number  f   = 0 , so rather than writing   }   3   4 0   in the symmetric equation we must write the equation   }   = 4   separately.  10.   v   = ( i   +   j )   ×   (   j   +   k ) =          i   j   k  1   1   0 0   1   1          =   i   3   j   +   k   is the direction of the line perpendicular to both   i   +   j   and   j   +   k .

The line has direction   v   =   h 1 >   2 >   1 i . Letting   S 0   = (1 >   3 1 >   1) , parametric equations are   {   = 1 +   w ,   |   =   3 1 + 2 w ,   }   = 1 +   w  and symmetric equations are   {   3   1 =   |   + 1 2   =   }   3   1 .  12.   Setting   }   = 0   we see that   (1 >   0 >   0)   satis fi es the equations of both planes, so they do in fact have a line of intersection. The line is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes, so a direction vector for the line is  v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   2 >   3 i × h 1 >   3 1 >   1 i   =   h 5 >   2 >   3 3 i . Taking the point   (1 >   0 >   0)   as   S 0 , parametric equations are   {   = 1 + 5 w ,  |   = 2 w ,   }   =   3 3 w , and symmetric equations are   {   3   1 5   =   |  2  =   }  3 3   .  13.

Since   v 1   ·   v 2   = 3 + 12   3   12   6   = 0 , the vectors and thus the lines are not perpendicular.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a) The line passes through the point   (1 >   3 5 >   6)   and a direction vector for the line is   h 3 1 >   2 >   3 3 i , so symmetric equations for the line are   {   3   1  3 1   =   |   + 5 2   =   }   3   6  3 3   . (b) The line intersects the   {| -plane when   }   = 0 , so we need   {   3   1  3 1   =   |   + 5 2   =  0   3   6  3 3   or   {   3   1  3 1   = 2   i   {   =   3 1 ,  |   + 5 2   = 2   i   |   =   3 1 . Thus the point of intersection with the   {| -plane is   ( 3 1 >   3 1 >   0) . Similarly for the   |} -plane, we need   {   = 0   i   1 =   |   + 5 2   =   }   3   6  3 3   i   |   =   3 3 ,   }   = 3 . Thus the line intersects the   |} -plane at   (0 >   3 3 >   3) . For the   {} -plane, we need   |   = 0   i   {   3   1  3 1   =  5 2  =   }   3   6  3 3   i   {   =   3   3 2   ,   }   =   3   3 2   . So the line intersects the   {} -plane at    3   3 2   >   0 >   3   3 2   .  16.   (a) A vector normal to the plane   {   3   |   + 3 }   = 7   is   n   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   3 i , and since the line is to be perpendicular to the plane,   n   is also a direction vector for the line. Thus parametric equations of the line are   {   = 2 +   w ,   |   = 4   3   w ,   }   = 6 + 3 w . (b) On the   {| -plane,   }   = 0 . So   }   = 6 + 3 w   = 0   i   w   =   3 2   in the parametric equations of the line, and therefore   {   = 0  and   |   = 6 , giving the point of intersection   (0 >   6 >   0) . For the   |} -plane,   {   = 0   so we get the same point of interesection:  (0 >   6 >   0) . For the   {} -plane,   |   = 0   which implies   w   = 4 , so   {   = 6   and   }   = 18   and the point of intersection is   (6 >   0 >   18) .  17.   From Equation 4, the line segment from   r 0   = 2   i   3   j   + 4   k   to   r 1   = 4   i   + 6   j   +   k   is  r ( w ) = (1   3   w )   r 0   +   w   r 1   = (1   3   w )(2   i   3   j   + 4   k ) +   w (4   i   + 6   j   +   k ) = (2   i   3   j   + 4   k ) +   w (2   i   + 7   j   3   3   k ) ,   0   $   w   $   1 .  18.   From Equation 4, the line segment from   r 0   = 10   i   + 3   j   +   k   to   r 1   = 5   i   + 6   j   3   3   k   is  r ( w ) = (1   3   w )   r 0   +   w   r 1   = (1   3   w )(10   i   + 3   j   +   k ) +   w (5   i   + 6   j   3   3   k ) = (10   i   + 3   j   +   k ) +   w ( 3 5   i   + 3   j   3   4   k ) ,   0   $   w   $   1 . The corresponding parametric equations are   {   = 10   3   5 w ,   |   = 3 + 3 w ,   }   = 1   3   4 w ,   0   $   w   $   1 .  19.   Since the direction vectors   h 2 >   3 1 >   3 i   and   h 4 >   3 2 >   5 i   are not scalar multiples of each other, the lines aren’t parallel. For the lines to intersect, we must be able to   fi nd one value of   w   and one value of   v   that produce the same point from the respective parametric equations. Thus we need to satisfy the following three equations:   3 + 2 w   = 1 + 4 v ,   4   3   w   = 3   3   2 v ,  1 + 3 w   = 4 + 5 v . Solving the last two equations we get   w   = 1 ,   v   = 0   and checking, we see that these values don’t satisfy the  fi rst equation. Thus the lines aren’t parallel and don’t intersect, so they must be skew lines.  20.   Since the direction vectors are   v 1   =   h 3 12 >   9 >   3 3 i   and   v 2   =   h 8 >   3 6 >   2 i , we have   v 1   =   3   3 2   v 2   so the lines are parallel.  21.   Since the direction vectors   h 1 >   3 2 >   3 3 i   and   h 1 >   3 >   3 7 i   aren’t scalar multiples of each other, the lines aren’t parallel. Parametric equations of the lines are   O 1 :   {   = 2 +   w ,   |   = 3   3   2 w ,   }   = 1   3   3 w   and   O 2 :   {   = 3 +   v ,   |   =   3 4 + 3 v ,   }   = 2   3   7 v . Thus, for the lines to intersect, the three equations   2 +   w   = 3 +   v ,   3   3   2 w   =   3 4 + 3 v , and   1   3   3 w   = 2   3   7 v   must be satis fi ed simultaneously. Solving the   fi rst two equations gives   w   = 2 ,   v   = 1   and checking, we see that these values do satisfy the third equation, so the lines intersect when   w   = 2   and   v   = 1 , that is, at the point   (4 >   3 1 >   3 5) .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The direction vectors   h 1 >   3 1 >   3 i   and   h 2 >   3 2 >   7 i   are not parallel, so neither are the lines. Parametric equations for the lines are  O 1 :   {   =   w ,   |   = 1   3   w ,   }   = 2 + 3 w   and   O 2 :   {   = 2 + 2 v ,   |   = 3   3   2 v ,   }   = 7 v . Thus, for the lines to interesect, the three equations   w   = 2 + 2 v ,   1   3   w   = 3   3   2 v , and   2 + 3 w   = 7 v   must be satis fi ed simultaneously. Solving the last two equations gives  w   =   3 10 ,   v   =   3 4   and checking, we see that these values don’t satisfy the   fi rst equation. Thus the lines aren’t parallel and don’t intersect, so they must be skew.  23.   Since the plane is perpendicular to the vector   h 1 >   3 2 >   5 i , we can take   h 1 >   3 2 >   5 i   as a normal vector to the plane.  (0 >   0 >   0)   is a point on the plane, so setting   d   = 1 ,   e   =   3 2 ,   f   = 5   and   { 0   = 0 ,   | 0   = 0 ,   } 0   = 0   in Equation 7 gives  1( {   3   0) + ( 3 2)( |   3   0) + 5( }   3   0) = 0   or   {   3   2 |   + 5 }   = 0   as an equation of the plane.  24.   2   i   +   j   3   k   =   h 2 >   1 >   3 1 i   is a normal vector to the plane and   (5 >   3 >   5)   is a point on the plane, so setting   d   = 2 ,   e   = 1 ,   f   =   3 1 > { 0   = 5 ,   | 0   = 3 ,   } 0   = 5   in Equation 7 gives   2( {   3   5) + 1( |   3   3) + ( 3 1)( }   3   5) = 0   or   2 {   +   |   3   }   = 8   as an equation of the plane.  25.   i   + 4   j   +   k   =   h 1 >   4 >   1 i   is a normal vector to the plane and    3 1 >   1 2   >   3    is a point on the plane, so setting   d   = 1 ,   e   = 4 ,   f   = 1 > { 0   =   3 1 ,   | 0   =   1 2   ,   } 0   = 3   in Equation 7 gives   1[ {   3   ( 3 1)] + 4    |   3   1 2     + 1( }   3   3) = 0   or   {   + 4 |   +   }   = 4   as an equation of the plane.  26.   Since the line is perpendicular to the plane, its direction vector   h 3 >   3 1 >   4 i   is a normal vector to the plane. The point   (2 >   0 >   1)   is on the plane, so an equation of the plane is   3( {   3   2) + ( 3 1)( |   3   0) + 4( }   3   1) = 0   or   3 {   3   |   + 4 }   = 10 .  27.   Since the two planes are parallel, they will have the same normal vectors. So we can take   n   =   h 5 >   3 1 >   3 1 i , and an equation of the plane is   5( {   3   1)   3   1[ |   3   ( 3 1)]   3   1[ }   3   ( 3 1)] = 0   or   5 {   3   |   3   }   = 7 .  28.   Since the two planes are parallel, they will have the same normal vectors. A normal vector for the plane   }   =   {   +   |   or  {   +   |   3   }   = 0   is   n   =   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i , and an equation of the desired plane is   1( {   3   2) + 1( |   3   4)   3   1( }   3   6) = 0   or  {   +   |   3   }   = 0   (the same plane!).  29.   Since the two planes are parallel, they will have the same normal vectors. So we can take   n   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i , and an equation of the plane is   1( {   3   1) + 1    |   3   1 2     + 1    }   3   1 3     = 0   or   {   +   |   +   }   =   11 6   or   6 {   + 6 |   + 6 }   = 11 .  30.   First, a normal vector for the plane   5 {   + 2 |   +   }   = 1   is   n   =   h 5 >   2 >   1 i . A direction vector for the line is   v   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   3 3 i , and since   n   ·   v   = 0   we know the line is perpendicular to   n   and hence parallel to the plane. Thus, there is a parallel plane which contains the line. By putting   w   = 0 , we know that the point   (1 >   2 >   4)   is on the line and hence the new plane. We can use the same normal vector   n   =   h 5 >   2 >   1 i , so an equation of the plane is   5( {   3   1) + 2( |   3   2) + 1( }   3   4) = 0   or   5 {   + 2 |   +   }   = 13 .  31.   Here the vectors   a   =   h 1   3   0 >   0   3   1 >   1   3   1 i   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   0 i   and   b   =   h 1   3   0 >   1   3   1 >   0   3   1 i   =   h 1 >   0 >   3 1 i   lie in the plane, so  a   ×   b   is a normal vector to the plane. Thus, we can take   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 1   3   0 >   0 + 1 >   0 + 1 i   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i . If   S 0   is the point  (0 >   1 >   1) , an equation of the plane is   1( {   3   0) + 1( |   3   1) + 1( }   3   1) = 0   or   {   +   |   +   }   = 2 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Here the vectors   a   =   h 2 >   3 4 >   6 i   and   b   =   h 5 >   1 >   3 i   lie in the plane, so  n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 3 12   3   6 >   30   3   6 >   2 + 20 i   =   h 3 18 >   24 >   22 i   is a normal vector to the plane and an equation of the plane is  3 18( {   3   0) + 24( |   3   0) + 22( }   3   0) = 0   or   3 18 {   + 24 |   + 22 }   = 0 .  33.   Here the vectors   a   =   h 8   3   3 >   2   3   ( 3 1) >   4   3   2 i   =   h 5 >   3 >   2 i   and   b   =   h 3 1   3   3 >   3 2   3   ( 3 1) >   3 3   3   2 i   =   h 3 4 >   3 1 >   3 5 i   lie in the plane, so a normal vector to the plane is   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 3 15 + 2 >   3 8 + 25 >   3 5 + 12 i   =   h 3 13 >   17 >   7 i   and an equation of the plane is   3 13( {   3   3) + 17[ |   3   ( 3 1)] + 7( }   3   2) = 0   or   3 13 {   + 1 7 |   + 7 }   =   3 42 .  34.   If we   fi rst   fi nd two nonparallel vectors in the plane, their cross product will be a normal vector to the plane. Since the given line lies in the plane, its direction vector   a   =   h 3 >   1 >   3 1 i   is one vector in the plane. We can verify that the given point   (1 >   2 >   3)  does not lie on this line, so to   fi nd another nonparallel vector   b   which lies in the plane, we can pick any point on the line and  fi nd a vector connecting the points. If we put   w   = 0 , we see that   (0 >   1 >   2)   is on the line, so  b   =   h 1   3   0 >   2   3   1 >   3   3   2 i   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   and   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 1 + 1 >   3 1   3   3 >   3   3   1 i   =   h 2 >   3 4 >   2 i . Thus, an equation of the plane is   2( {   3   1)   3   4( |   3   2) + 2( }   3   3) = 0   or   2 {   3   4 |   + 2 }   = 0 . (Equivalently, we can write   {   3   2 |   +   }   = 0 .)  35.   If we   fi rst   fi nd two nonparallel vectors in the plane, their cross product will be a normal vector to the plane. Since the given line lies in the plane, its direction vector   a   =   h 3 2 >   5 >   4 i   is one vector in the plane. We can verify that the given point   (6 >   0 >   3 2)  does not lie on this line, so to   fi nd another nonparallel vector   b   which lies in the plane, we can pick any point on the line and  fi nd a vector connecting the points. If we put   w   = 0 , we see that   (4 >   3 >   7)   is on the line, so  b   =   h 6   3   4 >   0   3   3 >   3 2   3   7 i   =   h 2 >   3 3 >   3 9 i   and   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 3 45 + 12 >   8   3   18 >   6   3   10 i   =   h 3 33 >   3 10 >   3 4 i . Thus, an equation of the plane is   3 33( {   3   6)   3   10( |   3   0)   3   4[ }   3   ( 3 2)] = 0   or   33 {   + 10 |   + 4 }   = 190 .  36.   Since the line   {   = 2 |   = 3 } , or   {   =   |  1 @ 2  =   }  1 @ 3   , lies in the plane, its direction vector   a   =   1 >   1 2   >   1 3     is parallel to the plane. The point   (0 >   0 >   0)   is on the line (put   w   = 0 ), and we can verify that the given point   (1 >   3 1 >   1)   in the plane is not on the line. The vector connecting these two points,   b   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   1 i , is therefore parallel to the plane, but not parallel to   h 1 >   2 >   3 i . Then  a   ×   b   =   1 2   +   1 3   >   1 3   3   1 >   3 1   3   1 2     =   5 6   >   3   2 3   >   3   3 2     is a normal vector to the plane, and an equation of the plane is  5 6   ( {   3   0)   3   2 3   ( |   3   0)   3   3 2   ( }   3   0) = 0   or   5 {   3   4 |   3   9 }   = 0 .  37.   A direction vector for the line of intersection is   a   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i × h 2 >   3 1 >   3 i   =   h 2 >   3 5 >   3 3 i , and   a   is parallel to the desired plane. Another vector parallel to the plane is the vector connecting any point on the line of intersection to the given point   ( 3 1 >   2 >   1)   in the plane. Setting   {   = 0 , the equations of the planes reduce to   |   3   }   = 2   and   3 |   + 3 }   = 1   with simultaneous solution   |   =   7 2   and   }   =   3 2   . So a point on the line is    0 >   7 2   >   3 2     and another vector parallel to the plane is  3 1 >   3   3 2   >   3   1 2   . Then a normal vector to the plane is   n   =   h 2 >   3 5 >   3 3 i ×   3 1 >   3   3 2   >   3   1 2     =   h 3 2 >   4 >   3 8 i   and an equation of the plane is   3 2( {   + 1) + 4( |   3   2)   3   8( }   3   1) = 0   or   {   3   2 |   + 4 }   =   3 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The points   (0 >   3 2 >   5)   and   ( 3 1 >   3 >   1)   lie in the desired plane, so the vector   v 1   =   h 3 1 >   5 >   3 4 i   connecting them is parallel to the plane. The desired plane is perpendicular to the plane   2 }   = 5 {   + 4 |   or   5 {   + 4 |   3   2 }   = 0   and for perpendicular planes, a normal vector for one plane is parallel to the other plane, so   v 2   =   h 5 >   4 >   3 2 i   is also parallel to the desired plane. A normal vector to the desired plane is   n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 3 10 + 16 >   3 20   3   2 >   3 4   3   25 i   =   h 6 >   3 22 >   3 29 i . Taking   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) = (0 >   3 2 >   5) , the equation we are looking for is   6( {   3   0)   3   22( |   + 2)   3   29( }   3   5) = 0   or  6 {   3   22 |   3   29 }   =   3 101 .  39.   If a plane is perpendicular to two other planes, its normal vector is perpendicular to the normal vectors of the other two planes. Thus   h 2 >   1 >   3 2 i × h 1 >   0 >   3 i   =   h 3   3   0 >   3 2   3   6 >   0   3   1 i   =   h 3 >   3 8 >   3 1 i   is a normal vector to the desired plane. The point  (1 >   5 >   1)   lies on the plane, so an equation is   3( {   3   1)   3   8( |   3   5)   3   ( }   3   1) = 0   or   3 {   3   8 |   3   }   =   3 38 .  40.   n 1   =   h 1 >   0 >   3 1 i   and   n 2   =   h 0 >   1 >   2 i . Setting   }   = 0 , it is easy to see that   (1 >   3 >   0)   is a point on the line of intersection of  {   3   }   = 1   and   |   + 2 }   = 3 . The direction of this line is   v 1   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   3 2 >   1 i . A second vector parallel to the desired plane is   v 2   =   h 1 >   1 >   3 2 i , since it is perpendicular to   {   +   |   3   2 }   = 1 . Therefore, a normal of the plane in question is  n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 4   3   1 >   1 + 2 >   1 + 2 i   =   h 3 >   3 >   3 i , or we can use   h 1 >   1 >   1 i . Taking   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) = (1 >   3 >   0) , the equation we are looking for is   ( {   3   1) + ( |   3   3) +   }   = 0   C   {   +   |   +   }   = 4 .  41.   To   fi nd the   { -intercept we set   |   =   }   = 0   in the equation   2 {   + 5 |   +   }   = 10  and obtain   2 {   = 10   i   {   = 5   so the   { -intercept is   (5 >   0 >   0) . When  {   =   }   = 0   we get   5 |   = 10   i   |   = 2 , so the   | -intercept is   (0 >   2 >   0) . Setting   {   =   |   = 0   gives   }   = 10 , so the   } -intercept is   (0 >   0 >   10)   and we graph the portion of the plane that lies in the   fi rst octant.  42.   To   fi nd the   { -intercept we set   |   =   }   = 0   in the equation   3 {   +   |   + 2 }   = 6  and obtain   3 {   = 6   i   {   = 2   so the   { -intercept is   (2 >   0 >   0) . When  {   =   }   = 0   we get   |   = 6   so the   | -intercept is   (0 >   6 >   0) . Setting   {   =   |   = 0  gives   2 }   = 6   i   }   = 3 , so the   } -intercept is   (0 >   0 >   3) . The   fi gure shows the portion of the plane that lies in the   fi rst octant.  43.   Setting   |   =   }   = 0   in the equation   6 {   3   3 |   + 4 }   = 6   gives   6 {   = 6   i  {   = 1 , when   {   =   }   = 0   we have   3 3 |   = 6   i   |   =   3 2 , and   {   =   |   = 0  implies   4 }   = 6   i   }   =   3 2   , so the intercepts are   (1 >   0 >   0) ,   (0 >   3 2 >   0) , and  (0 >   0 >   3 2   ) . The   fi gure shows the portion of the plane cut off by the coordinate planes.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Setting   |   =   }   = 0   in the equation   6 {   + 5 |   3   3 }   = 15   gives   6 {   = 15   i  {   =   5 2   , when   {   =   }   = 0   we have   5 |   = 15   i   |   = 3 , and   {   =   |   = 0  implies   3 3 }   = 15   i   }   =   3 5 , so the intercepts are   (   5 2   >   0 >   0) ,   (0 >   3 >   0) , and   (0 >   0 >   3 5) . The   fi gure shows the portion of the plane cut off by the coordinate planes.  45.   Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane:   (3   3   w )   3   (2 +   w ) + 2(5 w ) = 9   i  8 w   = 8   i   w   = 1 . Therefore, the point of intersection of the line and the plane is given by   {   = 3   3   1 = 2 ,   |   = 2 + 1 = 3 , and   }   = 5(1) = 5 >   that is, the point   (2 >   3 >   5) .  46.   Substitute the parametric equations of the line into the equation of the plane:   (1 + 2 w ) + 2(4 w )   3   (2   3   3 w ) + 1 = 0   i  13 w   = 0   i   w   = 0 . Therefore, the point of intersection of the line and the plane is given by   {   = 1 + 2(0) = 1 ,  |   = 4(0) = 0 , and   }   = 2   3   3(0) = 2 >   that is, the point   (1 >   0 >   2) .  47.   Parametric equations for the line are   {   =   w ,   |   = 1 +   w ,   }   =   1 2   w   and substituting into the equation of the plane gives  4( w )   3   (1 +   w ) + 3    1 2   w    = 8   i   9 2   w   = 9   i   w   = 2 . Thus   {   = 2 ,   |   = 1 + 2 = 3 ,   }   =   1 2   (2) = 1   and the point of intersection is   (2 >   3 >   1) .  48.   A direction vector for the line through   (1 >   0 >   1)   and   (4 >   3 2 >   2)   is   v   =   h 3 >   3 2 >   1 i   and, taking   S 0   = (1 >   0 >   1) , parametric equations for the line are   {   = 1 + 3 w ,   |   =   3 2 w ,   }   = 1 +   w . Substitution of the parametric equations into the equation of the plane gives   1 + 3 w   3   2 w   + 1 +   w   = 6   i   w   = 2 . Then   {   = 1 + 3(2) = 7 ,   |   =   3 2(2) =   3 4 , and   }   = 1 + 2 = 3   so the point of intersection is   (7 >   3 4 >   3) .  49.   Setting   {   = 0 , we see that   (0 >   1 >   0)   satis fi es the equations of both planes, so that they do in fact have a line of intersection.  v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i × h 1 >   0 >   1 i   =   h 1 >   0 >   3 1 i   is the direction of this line. Therefore, direction numbers of the intersecting line are   1 ,   0 ,   3 1 .  50.   The angle between the two planes is the same as the angle between their normal vectors. The normal vectors of the two planes are   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   and   h 1 >   2 >   3 i . The cosine of the angle      between these two planes is  cos      =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i · h 1 >   2 >   3 i |h 1 >   1 >   1 i| |h 1 >   2 >   3 i|   =   1 + 2 + 3  I 1 + 1 + 1   I 1 + 4 + 9  =   6  I 42  =  u   6 7   .  51.   Normal vectors for the planes are   n 1   =   h 1 >   4 >   3 3 i   and   n 2   =   h 3 3 >   6 >   7 i , so the normals (and thus the planes) aren’t parallel. But   n 1   ·   n 2   =   3 3 + 24   3   21 = 0 , so the normals (and thus the planes) are perpendicular.  52.   Normal vectors for the planes are   n 1   =   h 3 1 >   4 >   3 2 i   and   n 2   =   h 3 >   3 12 >   6 i . Since   n 2   =   3 3 n 1 , the normals (and thus the planes) are parallel.  53.   Normal vectors for the planes are   n 1   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   and   n 2   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   1 i . The normals are not parallel, so neither are the planes. Furthermore,   n 1   ·   n 2   = 1   3   1 + 1 = 1   6   = 0 , so the planes aren’t perpendicular. The angle between them is given by  cos      =   n 1   ·   n 2  | n 1 | | n 2 |   =   1  I 3   I 3  =  1 3   i      = cos 3 1    1 3     E   70 = 5  .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The normals are   n 1   =   h 2 >   3 3 >   4 i   and   n 2   =   h 1 >   6 >   4 i   so the planes aren’t parallel. Since   n 1   ·   n 2   = 2   3   18 + 16 = 0 , the normals (and thus the planes) are perpendicular.  55.   The normals are   n 1   =   h 1 >   3 4 >   2 i   and   n 2   =   h 2 >   3 8 >   4 i . Since   n 2   = 2 n 1 , the normals (and thus the planes) are parallel.  56.   The normal vectors are   n 1   =   h 1 >   2 >   2 i   and   n 2   =   h 2 >   3 1 >   2 i . The normals are not parallel, so neither are the planes. Furthermore,   n 1   ·   n 2   = 2   3   2 + 4 = 4   6   = 0 , so the planes aren’t perpendicular.

(a) To   fi nd a point on the line of intersection, set one of the variables equal to a constant, say   }   = 0 . (This will fail if the line of intersection does not cross the   {| -plane; in that case, try setting   {   or   |   equal to   0 .) The equations of the two planes reduce to   {   +   |   = 1   and   {   + 2 |   = 1 . Solving these two equations gives   {   = 1 ,   |   = 0 . Thus a point on the line is   (1 >   0 >   0) . A vector   v   in the direction of this intersecting line is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes, so we can take  v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i × h 1 >   2 >   2 i   =   h 2   3   2 >   1   3   2 >   2   3   1 i   =   h 0 >   3 1 >   1 i . By Equations 2, parametric equations for the line are   {   = 1 ,   |   =   3 w ,   }   =   w .

Therefore      = cos 3 1     5 3   I 3    E   15 = 8  .  58.   (a) If we set   }   = 0   then the equations of the planes reduce to   3 {   3   2 |   = 1   and   2 {   +   |   = 3   and solving these two equations gives   {   = 1 ,   |   = 1 . Thus a point on the line of intersection is   (1 >   1 >   0) . A vector   v   in the direction of this intersecting line is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes, so let   v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 3 >   3 2 >   1 i × h 2 >   1 >   3 3 i   =   h 5 >   11 >   7 i . By Equations 2, parametric equations for the line are   {   = 1 + 5 w ,   |   = 1 + 11 w ,   }   = 7 w .

Setting   }   = 0 , the equations of the two planes become   5 {   3   2 |   = 1   and   4 {   +   |   = 6 . Solving these two equations gives  {   = 1 ,   |   = 2   so a point on the line of intersection is   (1 >   2 >   0) . A vector   v   in the direction of this intersecting line is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes. So we can use   v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 5 >   3 2 >   3 2 i × h 4 >   1 >   1 i   =   h 0 >   3 13 >   13 i   or equivalently we can take   v   =   h 0 >   3 1 >   1 i , and symmetric equations for the line are   {   = 1 ,   |   3   2  3 1   =   }  1   or   {   = 1 ,   |   3   2 =   3 } .  60.   If we set   }   = 0   then the equations of the planes reduce to   2 {   3   |   3   5 = 0   and   4 {   + 3 |   3   5 = 0   and solving these two equations gives   {   = 2 ,   |   =   3 1 . Thus a point on the line of intersection is   (2 >   3 1 >   0) . A vector   v   in the direction of this intersecting line is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes, so take  v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 2 >   3 1 >   3 1 i × h 4 >   3 >   3 1 i   =   h 4 >   3 2 >   10 i   or equivalently we can take   v   =   h 2 >   3 1 >   5 i . Symmetric equations for the line are   {   3   2 2   =   |   + 1  3 1   =   }  5   .  61.   The distance from a point   ( {> |> } )   to   (1 >   0 >   3 2)   is   g 1   =   s ( {   3   1) 2   +   | 2   + ( }   + 2) 2   and the distance from   ( {> |> } )   to  (3 >   4 >   0)   is   g 2   =   s ( {   3   3) 2   + ( |   3   4) 2   +   } 2 .

Alternatively, you can argue that the segment joining points   (1 >   0 >   3 2)   and   (3 >   4 >   0)   is perpendicular to the plane and the plane includes the midpoint of the segment.  62.   The distance from a point   ( {> |> } )   to   (2 >   5 >   5)   is   g 1   =   s ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   3   5) 2   + ( }   3   5) 2   and the distance from   ( {> |> } )  to   ( 3 6 >   3 >   1)   is   g 2   =   s ( {   + 6) 2   + ( |   3   3) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2 . The plane consists of all points   ( {> |> } )   where   g 1   =   g 2   i  g   2 1   =   g   2 2   C   ( {   3   2) 2   + ( |   3   5) 2   + ( }   3   5) 2   = ( {   + 6) 2   + ( |   3   3) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   C  { 2   3   4 {   +   | 2   3   10 |   +   } 2   3   10 }   + 54 =   { 2   + 12 {   +   | 2   3   6 |   +   } 2   3   2 }   + 46   C   16 {   + 4 |   + 8 }   = 8   so an equation for the plane is   16 {   + 4 |   + 8 }   = 8   or equivalently   4 {   +   |   + 2 }   = 2 .  63.   The plane contains the points   ( d>   0 >   0) ,   (0 > e>   0)   and   (0 >   0 > f ) . Thus the vectors   a   =   h 3 d> e>   0 i   and   b   =   h 3 d>   0 > f i   lie in the plane, and   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h ef   3   0 >   0 +   df>   0 +   de i   =   h ef> df> de i   is a normal vector to the plane. The equation of the plane is therefore   ef{   +   df|   +   de}   =   def   + 0 + 0   or   ef{   +   df|   +   de}   =   def . Notice that if   d   6   = 0 ,   e   6   = 0   and   f   6   = 0   then we can rewrite the equation as   { d   +   | e   +   } f   = 1 . This is a good equation to remember!  64.   (a) For the lines to intersect, we must be able to   fi nd one value of   w   and one value of   v   satisfying the three equations  1 +   w   = 2   3   v ,   1   3   w   =   v   and   2 w   = 2 . From the third we get   w   = 1 , and putting this in the second gives   v   = 0 . These values of   v   and   w   do satisfy the   fi rst equation, so the lines intersect at the point   S 0   = (1 + 1 >   1   3   1 >   2(1)) = (2 >   0 >   2) . (b) The direction vectors of the lines are   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i   and   h 3 1 >   1 >   0 i , so a normal vector for the plane is  h 3 1 >   1 >   0 i × h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i   =   h 2 >   2 >   0 i   and it contains the point   (2 >   0 >   2) . Then an equation of the plane is  2( {   3   2) + 2( |   3   0) + 0( }   3   2) = 0   C   {   +   |   = 2 .  65.   Two vectors which are perpendicular to the required line are the normal of the given plane,   h 1 >   1 >   1 i , and a direction vector for the given line,   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i . So a direction vector for the required line is   h 1 >   1 >   1 i × h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i   =   h 3 >   3 1 >   3 2 i . Thus   O   is given by   h {> |> } i   =   h 0 >   1 >   2 i   +   w h 3 >   3 1 >   3 2 i , or in parametric form,   {   = 3 w ,   |   = 1   3   w ,   }   = 2   3   2 w .  66.   Let   O   be the given line. Then   (1 >   1 >   0)   is the point on   O   corresponding to   w   = 0 .   O   is in the direction of   a   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i  and   b   =   h 3 1 >   0 >   2 i   is the vector joining   (1 >   1 >   0)   and   (0 >   1 >   2) . Then  b   3   proj a   b   =   h 3 1 >   0 >   2 i   3   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i · h 3 1 >   0 >   2 i  1 2   + ( 3 1) 2   + 2 2   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i   =   h 3 1 >   0 >   2 i   3   1 2   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i   =   3   3 2   >   1 2   >   1    is a direction vector for the required line. Thus   2   3   3 2   >   1 2   >   1    =   h 3 3 >   1 >   2 i   is also a direction vector, and the line has parametric equations   {   =   3 3 w ,  |   = 1 +   w ,   }   = 2 + 2 w .

Then   n 1   =   h 3 >   6 >   3 3 i ,   n 2   =   h 4 >   3 12 >   8 i ,   n 3   =   h 3 >   3 9 >   6 i ,   n 4   =   h 1 >   2 >   3 1 i . Now   n 1   = 3 n 4 , so   n 1   and   n 4   are parallel, and hence   S 1   and   S 4   are parallel; similarly   S 2   and   S 3   are parallel because   n 2   =   4 3   n 3 . However,   n 1  and   n 2   are not parallel (so not all four planes are parallel). Notice that the point   (2 >   0 >   0)   lies on both   S 1   and   S 4 , so these two planes are identical. The point      5 4   >   0 >   0    lies on   S 2   but not on   S 3 , so these are different planes.  68.   Let   O l   have direction vector   v l . Rewrite the symmetric equations for   O 3   as   {   3   1 1 @ 2   =   |   3   1  3 1 @ 4  =   }   + 1 1   ; then   v 1   =   h 6 >   3 3 >   12 i ,  v 2   =   h 2 >   1 >   4 i ,   v 3   =   1 2   >   3   1 4   >   1  , and   v 4   =   h 4 >   2 >   8 i .   v 1   = 12 v 3 , so   O 1   and   O 3   are parallel.   v 4   = 2 v 2 , so   O 2   and   O 4   are parallel. (Note that   O 1   and   O 2   are not parallel.)   O 1   contains the point   (1 >   1 >   5) , but this point does not lie on   O 3 , so they’re not identical.   (3 >   1 >   5)   lies on   O 4   and also on   O 2   (for   w   = 1 ), so   O 2   and   O 4   are the same line.  69.   Let   T   = (1 >   3 >   4)   and   U   = (2 >   1 >   1) , points on the line corresponding to   w   = 0   and   w   = 1 . Let  S   = (4 >   1 >   3 2) .

Then   a   =   3 <  TU   =   h 2 >   3 2 >   1 i   and   b   =   3 3 <  TS   =   h 0 >   3 5 >   0 i .

By Equation 9, the distance is   G   =   | 1( 3 6)   3   2(3)   3   4(5)   3   8 |  s 1 2   + ( 3 2) 2   + ( 3 4) 2   =   | 3 40 |  I 21   =   40  I 21   .  73.   Put   |   =   }   = 0   in the equation of the   fi rst plane to get the point   (2 >   0 >   0)   on the plane. Because the planes are parallel, the distance   G   between them is the distance from   (2 >   0 >   0)   to the second plane. By Equation 9,  G   =   | 4(2)   3   6(0) + 2(0)   3   3 |  s 4 2   + ( 3 6) 2   + (2) 2   =   5  I 56  =   5 2   I 14   or   5   I 14 28   .  74.   Put   {   =   |   = 0   in the equation of the   fi rst plane to get the point   (0 >   0 >   0)   on the plane. Because the planes are parallel the distance   G   between them is the distance from   (0 >   0 >   0)   to the second plane   3 {   3   6 |   + 9 }   3   1 = 0 . By Equation 9,  G   =   | 3(0)   3   6(0) + 9(0)   3   1 |  s 3 2   + ( 3 6) 2   + 9 2   =   1  I 126  =   1 3   I 14   .  75.   The distance between two parallel planes is the same as the distance between a point on one of the planes and the other plane. Let   S 0   = ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   be a point on the plane given by   d{   +   e|   +   f}   +   g 1   = 0 . Then   d{ 0   +   e| 0   +   f} 0   +   g 1   = 0   and the  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The planes must have parallel normal vectors, so if   d{   +   e|   +   f}   +   g   = 0   is such a plane, then for some   w   6   = 0 ,  h d> e> f i   =   w h 1 >   2 >   3 2 i   =   h w>   2 w>   3 2 w i . So this plane is given by the equation   {   + 2 |   3   2 }   +   n   = 0 , where   n   =   g@w . By Exercise 75, the distance between the planes is   2 =   | 1   3   n |  s 1 2   + 2 2   + ( 3 2) 2   C   6 =   | 1   3   n |   C   n   = 7   or   3 5 . So the desired planes have equations   {   + 2 |   3   2 }   = 7   and   {   + 2 |   3   2 }   =   3 5 .  77.   O 1 :   {   =   |   =   }   i   {   =   |   ( 1 ).   O 2 :   {   + 1 =   |@ 2 =   }@ 3   i   {   + 1 =   |@ 2   ( 2 ).   The solution of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is  {   =   |   =   3 2 . However, when   {   =   3 2 ,   {   =   }   i   }   =   3 2 , but   {   + 1 =   }@ 3   i   }   =   3 3 , a contradiction. Hence the lines do not intersect. For   O 1 ,   v 1   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i , and for   O 2 ,   v 2   =   h 1 >   2 >   3 i , so the lines are not parallel. Thus the lines are skew lines. If two lines are skew, they can be viewed as lying in two parallel planes and so the distance between the skew lines would be the same as the distance between these parallel planes. The common normal vector to the planes must be perpendicular to both   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   and   h 1 >   2 >   3 i , the direction vectors of the two lines. So set  n   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i × h 1 >   2 >   3 i   =   h 3   3   2 >   3 3 + 1 >   2   3   1 i   =   h 1 >   3 2 >   1 i . From above, we know that   ( 3 2 >   3 2 >   3 2)   and   ( 3 2 >   3 2 >   3 3)  are points of   O 1   and   O 2   respectively. So in the notation of Equation 8,   1( 3 2)   3   2( 3 2) + 1( 3 2) +   g 1   = 0   i   g 1   = 0   and  1( 3 2)   3   2( 3 2) + 1( 3 3) +   g 2   = 0   i   g 2   = 1 . By Exercise 75, the distance between these two skew lines is   G   =   | 0   3   1 |  I 1 + 4 + 1  =   1  I 6   .  Alternate solution (without reference to planes):   A vector which is perpendicular to both of the lines is  n   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i × h 1 >   2 >   3 i   =   h 1 >   3 2 >   1 i . Pick any point on each of the lines, say   ( 3 2 >   3 2 >   3 2)   and   ( 3 2 >   3 2 >   3 3) , and form the vector   b   =   h 0 >   0 >   1 i   connecting the two points. The distance between the two skew lines is the absolute value of the scalar projection of   b   along   n , that is,   G   =   | n   ·   b | | n |   =   | 1   ·   0   3   2   ·   0 + 1   ·   1 |  I 1 + 4 + 1   =   1  I 6   .  78.   First notice that if two lines are skew, they can be viewed as lying in two parallel planes and so the distance between the skew lines would be the same as the distance between these parallel planes. The common normal vector to the planes must be perpendicular to both   v 1   =   h 1 >   6 >   2 i   and   v 2   =   h 2 >   15 >   6 i , the direction vectors of the two lines respectively. Thus set  n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 36   3   30 >   4   3   6 >   15   3   12 i   =   h 6 >   3 2 >   3 i . Setting   w   = 0   and   v   = 0   gives the points   (1 >   1 >   0)   and   (1 >   5 >   3 2) . So in the notation of Equation 8,   6   3   2 + 0 +   g 1   = 0   i   g 1   =   3 4   and   6   3   10   3   6 +   g 2   = 0   i   g 2   = 10 . Then by Exercise 75, the distance between the two skew lines is given by   G   =   | 3 4   3   10 |  I 36 + 4 + 9  =  14 7   = 2 .  Alternate solution (without reference to planes):   We already know that the direction vectors of the two lines are  v 1   =   h 1 >   6 >   2 i   and   v 2   =   h 2 >   15 >   6 i . Then   n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 6 >   3 2 >   3 i   is perpendicular to both lines. Pick any point on  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Then the distance between the two skew lines is the absolute value of the scalar projection of   b   along   n , that is,  G   =   | n   ·   b | | n |   =   1  I 36 + 4 + 9   | 0   3   8   3   6 |   =  14 7   = 2 .  79.   A direction vector for   O 1   is   v 1   =   h 2 >   0 >   3 1 i   and a direction vector for   O 2   is   v 2   =   h 3 >   2 >   2 i . These vectors are not parallel so neither are the lines. Parametric equations for the lines are   O 1 :   {   = 2 w ,   |   = 0 ,   }   =   3 w , and   O 2 :   {   = 1 + 3 v ,   |   =   3 1 + 2 v ,  }   = 1 + 2 v . No values of   w   and   v   satisfy these equations simultaneously, so the lines don’t intersect and hence are skew. We can view the lines as lying in two parallel planes; a common normal vector to the planes is   n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 2 >   3 7 >   4 i . Line  O 1   passes through the origin, so   (0 >   0 >   0)   lies on one of the planes, and   (1 >   3 1 >   1)   is a point on   O 2   and therefore on the other plane. Equations of the planes then are   2 {   3   7 |   + 4 }   = 0   and   2 {   3   7 |   + 4 }   3   13 = 0 , and by Exercise 75, the distance between the two skew lines is   G   =   | 0   3   ( 3 13) |  I 4 + 49 + 16  =   13  I 69   .  Alternate solution (without reference to planes):   Direction vectors of the two lines are   v 1   =   h 2 >   0 >   3 1 i   and   v 2   =   h 3 >   2 >   2 i . Then   n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 2 >   3 7 >   4 i   is perpendicular to both lines. Pick any point on each of the lines, say   (0 >   0 >   0)   and   (1 >   3 1 >   1) , and form the vector   b   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   1 i   connecting the two points. Then the distance between the two skew lines is the absolute value of the scalar projection of   b   along   n , that is,   G   =   | n   ·   b | | n |   =   | 2 + 7 + 4 |  I 4 + 49 + 16  =   13  I 69   .  80.   A direction vector for the line   O 1   is   v 1   =   h 1 >   2 >   2 i . A normal vector for the plane    1   is   n 1   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i . The vector from the point   (0 >   0 >   1)   to   (3 >   2 >   3 1) ,   h 3 >   2 >   3 2 i , is parallel to the plane    2 , as is the vector from   (0 >   0 >   1)   to   (1 >   2 >   1) , namely   h 1 >   2 >   0 i . Thus a normal vector for    2   is   h 3 >   2 >   3 2 i × h 1 >   2 >   0 i   =   h 4 >   3 2 >   4 i , or we can use   n 2   =   h 2 >   3 1 >   2 i , and a direction vector for the line   O 2   of intersection of these planes is   v 2   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i × h 2 >   3 1 >   2 i   =   h 0 >   2 >   1 i . Notice that the point  (3 >   2 >   3 1)   lies on both planes, so it also lies on   O 2 . The lines are skew, so we can view them as lying in two parallel planes; a common normal vector to the planes is   n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 3 2 >   3 1 >   2 i . Line   O 1   passes through the point   (1 >   2 >   6) , so   (1 >   2 >   6)  lies on one of the planes, and   (3 >   2 >   3 1)   is a point on   O 2   and therefore on the other plane. Equations of the planes then are  3 2 {   3   |   + 2 }   3   8 = 0   and   3 2 {   3   |   + 2 }   + 10 = 0 , and by Exercise 75, the distance between the lines is  G   =   | 3 8   3   10 |  I 4 + 1 + 4  =  18 3   = 6 . Alternatively, direction vectors for the lines are   v 1   =   h 1 >   2 >   2 i   and   v 2   =   h 0 >   2 >   1 i , so   n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 3 2 >   3 1 >   2 i   is perpendicular to both lines. Pick any point on each of the lines, say   (1 >   2 >   6)   and   (3 >   2 >   3 1) , and form the vector  b   =   h 2 >   0 >   3 7 i   connecting the two points. Then the distance between the two skew lines is the absolute value of the scalar projection of   b   along   n , that is,   G   =   | n   ·   b | | n |   =   | 3 4 + 0   3   14 |  I 4 + 1 + 4   =  18 3   = 6 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

If   d   6   = 0 , then   d{   +   e|   +   f}   +   g   = 0   i   d ( {   +   g@d ) +   e ( |   3   0) +   f ( }   3   0) = 0   which by (7) is the scalar equation of the plane through the point   ( 3 g@d>   0 >   0)   with normal vector   h d> e> f i . Similarly, if   e   6   = 0   (or if   f   6   = 0 ) the equation of the plane can be rewritten as   d ( {   3   0) +   e ( |   +   g@e ) +   f ( }   3   0) = 0   [or as   d ( {   3   0) +   e ( |   3   0) +   f ( }   +   g@f ) = 0 ] which by (7) is the scalar equation of a plane through the point   (0 >   3 g@e>   0)   [or the point   (0 >   0 >   3 g@f ) ] with normal vector   h d> e> f i .  82.   (a) The planes   {   +   |   +   }   =   f   have normal vector   h 1 >   1 >   1 i , so they are all parallel. Their   { -,   | -, and   } -intercepts are all   f . When   f A   0   their intersection with the   fi rst octant is an equilateral triangle and when   f ?   0  their intersection with the octant diagonally opposite the   fi rst is an equilateral triangle. (b) The planes   {   +   |   +   f}   = 1   have   { -intercept   1 ,   | -intercept   1 , and   } -intercept   1 @f . The plane with   f   = 0   is parallel to the  } -axis. As   f   gets larger, the planes get closer to the   {| -plane. (c) The planes   |   cos      +   }   cos      = 1   have normal vectors   h 0 >   cos   >   sin    i , which are perpendicular to the   { -axis, and so the planes are parallel to the   { -axis. We look at their intersection with the   |} -plane. These are lines that are perpendicular to  h cos   >   sin    i   and pass through   (cos   >   sin    ) , since   cos 2      + sin 2      = 1 . So these are the tangent lines to the unit circle. Thus the family consists of all planes tangent to the circular cylinder with radius   1   and axis the   { -axis.

If we view the screen from the camera’s location, the vertical clipping plane on the left passes through the points  (1000 >   0 >   0) ,   (0 >   3 400 >   0) , and   (0 >   3 400 >   600) . A vector from the   fi rst point to the second is   v 1   =   h 3 1000 >   3 400 >   0 i  and a vector from the   fi rst point to the third is   v 2   =   h 3 1000 >   3 400 >   600 i . A normal vector for the clipping plane is  v 1   ×   v 2   =   3 240 , 000   i   + 600 , 000   j   or   3 2   i   + 5   j , and an equation for the plane is  3 2( {   3   1000) + 5( |   3   0) + 0( }   3   0) = 0   i   2 {   3   5 |   = 2000 . By symmetry, the vertical clipping plane on the right is given by   2 {   + 5 |   = 2000 . The lower clipping plane is   }   = 0 . The upper clipping plane passes through the points   (1000 >   0 >   0) ,  (0 >   3 400 >   600) , and   (0 >   400 >   600) . Vectors from the   fi rst point to the second and third points are   v 1   =   h 3 1000 >   3 400 >   600 i  and   v 2   =   h 3 1000 >   400 >   600 i , and a normal vector for the plane is   v 1   ×   v 2   =   3 480 , 000   i   3   800 , 000   k   or   3   i   + 5   k .

A direction vector for the line   O   is   v   =   h 630 >   390 >   162 i   and taking   S 0   = (230 >   3 285 >   102) , parametric equations are   {   = 230 + 630 w ,   |   =   3 285 + 390 w ,   }   = 102 + 162 w .   O   intersects the left clipping plane when  2(230 + 630 w )   3   5( 3 285 + 390 w ) = 2000   i   w   =   3   1 6   . The corresponding point is   (125 >   3 350 >   75) .

Thus   O   should be clipped at the points   (125 >   3 350 >   75)   and   (650 >   3 25 >   210) .  2.   A sight line from the camera at   (1000 >   0 >   0)   to the left endpoint   (125 >   3 350 >   75)   of the clipped line has direction  v   =   h 3 875 >   3 350 >   75 i . Parametric equations are   {   = 1000   3   875 w ,   |   =   3 350 w ,   }   = 75 w . This line intersects the screen when   {   = 0   i   1000   3   875 w   = 0   i   w   =   8 7   , corresponding to the point    0 >   3 400 >   600 7   . Similarly, a sight line from the camera to the right endpoint   (650 >   3 25 >   210)   of the clipped line has direction   h 3 350 >   3 25 >   210 i   and parametric equations are   {   = 1000   3   350 w ,   |   =   3 25 w ,   }   = 210 w .   {   = 0   i   1000   3   350 w   = 0   i   w   =   20 7   , corresponding to the point   0 >   3   500 7   >   600  . Thus the projection of the clipped line is the line segment between the points    0 >   3 400 >   600 7     and   0 >   3   500 7   >   600  .  3.   From Equation 12.5.4, equations for the four sides of the screen are   r 1 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 0 >   3 400 >   0 i   +   w   h 0 >   3 400 >   600 i ,  r 2 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 0 >   3 400 >   600 i   +   w   h 0 >   400 >   600 i ,  r 3 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 0 >   400 >   0 i   +   w   h 0 >   400 >   600 i , and  r 4 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 0 >   3 400 >   0 i   +   w   h 0 >   400 >   0 i . The clipped line segment connects the points   (125 >   3 350 >   75)   and  (650 >   3 25 >   210) , so an equation for the segment is  r 5 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 125 >   3 350 >   75 i   +   w   h 650 >   3 25 >   210 i . The projection of the clipped segment connects the points   0 >   3 400 >   600 7     and    0 >   3   500 7   >   600  , so an equation is   r 6 ( w ) = (1   3   w )   0 >   3 400 >   600 7     +   w   0 >   3   500 7   >   600  . The sight line on the left connects the points   (1000 >   0 >   0)   and    0 >   3 400 >   600 7   , so an equation is  r 7 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 1000 >   0 >   0 i   +   w   0 >   3 400 >   600 7   . The other sight line connects   (1000 >   0 >   0)   to    0 >   3   500 7   >   600  , so an equation is   r 8 ( w ) = (1   3   w ) h 1000 >   0 >   0 i   +   w   0 >   3   500 7   >   600  .  4.   The vector from   (621 >   3 147 >   206)   to   (563 >   31 >   242) ,   v 1   =   h 3 58 >   178 >   36 i , lies in the plane of the rectangle, as does the vector from   (621 >   3 147 >   206)   to   (657 >   3 111 >   86) ,   v 2   =   h 36 >   36 >   3 120 i . A normal vector for the plane is  v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 3 1888 >   3 142 >   3 708 i   or   h 8 >   2 >   3 i , and an equation of the plane is   8 {   + 2 |   + 3 }   = 5292 . The line   O   intersects this plane when   8(230 + 630 w ) + 2( 3 285 + 390 w ) + 3(102 + 162 w ) = 5292   i   w   =   1858 3153   E   0 = 589 . The corresponding point is approximately   (601 = 25 >   3 55 = 18 >   197 = 46) . Starting at this point, a portion of the line is hidden behind the rectangle. The line becomes visible again at the left edge of the rectangle, speci fi cally the edge between the points   (621 >   3 147 >   206)   and  (657 >   3 111 >   86) . (This is most easily determined by graphing the rectangle and the line.) A plane through these two points and the camera’s location,   (1000 >   0 >   0) , will clip the line at the point it becomes visible. Two vectors in this plane are  v 1   =   h 3 379 >   3 147 >   206 i   and   v 2   =   h 3 343 >   3 111 >   86 i . A normal vector for the plane is  v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 10224 >   3 38064 >   3 8352 i   and an equation of the plane is   213 {   3   793 |   3   174 }   = 213 , 000 .

The corresponding point is approximately   (367 = 14 >   3 200 = 11 >   137 = 26) . Thus the portion of   O   that should be removed is the segment between the points   (601 = 25 >   3 55 = 18 >   197 = 46)   and   (367 = 14 >   3 200 = 11 >   137 = 26) .  12.6   Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces 1.   (a) In   R 2 , the equation   |   =   { 2   represents a parabola. (b) In   R 3 , the equation   |   =   { 2   doesn’t involve   } , so any horizontal plane with equation   }   =   n   intersects the graph in a curve with equation   |   =   { 2 . Thus, the surface is a parabolic cylinder, made up of in fi nitely many shifted copies of the same parabola. The rulings are parallel to the   } -axis. (c) In   R 3 , the equation   }   =   | 2   also represents a parabolic cylinder. Since   {   doesn’t appear, the graph is formed by moving the parabola   }   =   | 2   in the direction of the   { -axis. Thus, the rulings of the cylinder are parallel to the   { -axis.  2.   (a)   (b) Since the equation   |   =   h {   doesn’t involve   } , horizontal traces are copies of the curve   |   =   h { . The rulings are parallel to the   } -axis. (c) The equation   }   =   h |   doesn’t involve   { , so vertical traces in   {   =   n   (parallel to the  |} -plane) are copies of the curve   }   =   h |   . The rulings are parallel to the   { -axis.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Since   |   is missing from the equation, the vertical traces  { 2   +   } 2   = 1 ,   |   =   n , are copies of the same circle in the plane   |   =   n . Thus the surface   { 2   +   } 2   = 1   is a circular cylinder with rulings parallel to the   | -axis.  4.   Since   }   is missing from the equation, the horizontal traces   4 { 2   +   | 2   = 4 ,   }   =   n , are copies of the same ellipse in the plane   }   =   n . Thus the surface  4 { 2   +   | 2   = 4   is an elliptic cylinder with rulings parallel to the   } -axis.  5.   Since   {   is missing, each vertical trace   }   = 1   3   | 2 ,  {   =   n , is a copy of the same parabola in the plane  {   =   n .

Since   {   is missing, each vertical trace   |   =   } 2 ,   {   =   n , is a copy of the same parabola in the plane   {   =   n . Thus the surface   |   =   } 2   is a parabolic cylinder with rulings parallel to the   { -axis.  7.   Since   }   is missing, each horizontal trace   {|   = 1 ,  }   =   n , is a copy of the same hyperbola in the plane  }   =   n . Thus the surface   {|   = 1   is a hyperbolic cylinder with rulings parallel to the   } -axis.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Since   {   is missing, each vertical trace   }   = sin   | ,  {   =   n , is a copy of a sine curve in the plane   {   =   n .

(a) The traces of   { 2   +   | 2   3   } 2   = 1   in   {   =   n   are   | 2   3   } 2   = 1   3   n 2 , a family of hyperbolas. (Note that the hyperbolas are oriented differently for   3 1   ? n ?   1   than for   n ?   3 1   or   n A   1 .)

For   n   = 0 , the trace in the  {| -plane, the circle is of radius   1 . As   | n |   increases, so does the radius of the circle. This behavior, combined with the hyperbolic vertical traces, gives the graph of the hyperboloid of one sheet in Table 1. (b) The shape of the surface is unchanged, but the hyperboloid is rotated so that its axis is the   | -axis. Traces in   |   =   n   are circles, while traces in   {   =   n   and   }   =   n   are hyperbolas. (c) Completing the square in   |   gives   { 2   + ( |   + 1) 2   3   } 2   = 1 . The surface is a hyperboloid identical to the one in part (a) but shifted one unit in the negative   | -direction.  10.

The traces in   }   =   n   are   { 2   +   | 2   =   n 2   3   1 , a family of circles for   | n |   A   1 . As   | n |   increases, the radii of the circles increase; the traces are empty for   | n |   ?   1 . This behavior, combined with the vertical traces, gives the graph of the hyperboloid of two sheets in Table 1.

The traces in   |   =   n   are the parabolas  {   =   3 } 2   +   n 2 , opening in the negative   { -direction, and the traces in   }   =   n  are the parabolas   {   =   | 2   3   n 2   which open in the positive   { -direction. The graph is a hyperbolic paraboloid with saddle point   (0 >   0 >   0) .  21.   This is the equation of an ellipsoid:   { 2   + 4 | 2   + 9 } 2   =   { 2   +   | 2  (1 @ 2) 2   +   } 2  (1 @ 3) 2   = 1 , with   { -intercepts   ± 1 ,   | -intercepts   ±   1 2  and   } -intercepts   ±   1 3   . So the major axis is the   { -axis and the only possible graph is VII.  22.   This is the equation of an ellipsoid:   9 { 2   + 4 | 2   +   } 2   =   { 2  (1 @ 3) 2   +   | 2  (1 @ 2) 2   +   } 2   = 1 , with   { -intercepts   ±   1 3   ,   | -intercepts   ±   1 2  and   } -intercepts   ± 1 . So the major axis is the   } -axis and the only possible graph is IV.  23.   This is the equation of a hyperboloid of one sheet, with   d   =   e   =   f   = 1 . Since the coef fi cient of   | 2   is negative, the axis of the hyperboloid is the   | -axis, hence the correct graph is II.  24.   This is a hyperboloid of two sheets, with   d   =   e   =   f   = 1 . This surface does not intersect the   {} -plane at all, so the axis of the hyperboloid is the   | -axis and the graph is III.  25.   There are no real values of   {   and   }   that satisfy this equation for   | ?   0 , so this surface does not extend to the left of the  {} -plane. The surface intersects the plane   |   =   n A   0   in an ellipse. Notice that   |   occurs to the   fi rst power whereas   {   and   }  occur to the second power. So the surface is an elliptic paraboloid with axis the   | -axis. Its graph is VI.  26.   This is the equation of a cone with axis the   | -axis, so the graph is I.  27.   This surface is a cylinder because the variable   |   is missing from the equation. The intersection of the surface and the   {} -plane is an ellipse. So the graph is VIII.  28.   This is the equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid. The trace in the   {| -plane is the parabola   |   =   { 2 . So the correct graph is V.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The surface is a paraboloid of revolution (circular paraboloid) with vertex at the origin, axis the   | -axis and opens to the right. Thus the trace in the   |} -plane is also a parabola:   |   =   } 2 ,   {   = 0 . The equation is   |   =   { 2   +   } 2 .  44.   The surface is a right circular cone with vertex at   (0 ,   0 ,   0)  and axis the   { -axis. For   {   =   n   6   = 0 , the trace is a circle with center   ( n ,   0 ,   0)   and radius   u   =   |   =   {  3  =   n  3   . Thus the equation is   ( {@ 3) 2   =   | 2   +   } 2   or   { 2   = 9 | 2   + 9 } 2 .  45.   Let   S   = ( { ,   | ,   } )   be an arbitrary point equidis tan t from   ( 3 1 ,   0 ,   0)   and the plane   {   = 1 . Then the distance from   S   to  ( 3 1 ,   0 ,   0)   is   s ( {   + 1) 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   and the distance from   S   to the plane   {   = 1   is   | {   3   1 |   @ I 1 2   =   | {   3   1 |  (by Equation 12.5.9).

Thus the collection of all such points   S   is a circular paraboloid with vertex at the origin, axis the   { -axis, which opens in the negative direction.  46.   Let   S   = ( {> |> } )   be an arbitrary point whose distance from the   { -axis is twice its distance from the   |} -plane. The distance from   S   to the   { -axis is   s ( {   3   { ) 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   s | 2   +   } 2   and the distance from   S   to the   |} -plane ( {   = 0 ) is   | { |   @ 1 =   | { | .

Horizontal traces in   }   =   n   are   { 2  d 2   +   | 2  e 2   = 1 +   n 2  f 2   , a family of ellipses, but we know that the traces are circles so we must have   d   =   e .

Subtracting, we get   6 {   + 5 |   = 2 , which is linear and therefore the equation of a plane. Thus the curve of intersection lies in this plane.  51.   The curve of intersection looks like a bent ellipse. The projection of this curve onto the   {| -plane is the set of points   ( {> |>   0)   which satisfy   { 2   +   | 2   = 1   3   | 2   C   { 2   + 2 | 2   = 1   C  { 2   +   | 2   1 @ I 2    2   = 1 . This is an equation of an ellipse.  12   Review 1.   A scalar is a real number, while a vector is a quantity that has both a real-valued magnitude and a direction.  2.   To add two vectors geometrically, we can use either the Triangle Law or the Parallelogram Law, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 in Section 12.2. Algebraically, we add the corresponding components of the vectors.  3.   For   f A   0 ,   f   a   is a vector with the same direction as   a   and length   f   times the length of   a . If   f ?   0 ,   f a   points in the opposite direction as   a   and has length   | f |   times the length of   a . (See Figures 7 and 15 in Section 12.2.) Algebraically, to   fi nd   f   a   we multiply each component of   a   by   f .  4.   See (1) in Section 12.2.  5.   See Theorem 12.3.3 and De fi nition 12.3.1.  6.   The dot product can be used to   fi nd the angle between two vectors and the scalar projection of one vector onto another. In particular, the dot product can determine if two vectors are orthogonal. Also, the dot product can be used to determine the work done moving an object given the force and displacement vectors.  7.   See the boxed equations as well as Figures 4 and 5 and the accompanying discussion on page 828 [ET 804].  8.   See Theorem 12.4.9 and the preceding discussion; use either (4) or (7) in Section 12.4.  9.   The cross product can be used to create a vector orthogonal to two given vectors as well as to determine if two vectors are parallel. The cross product can also be used to   fi nd the area of a parallelogram determined by two vectors. In addition, the cross product can be used to determine torque if the force and position vectors are known.  10.   (a) The area of the parallelogram determined by   a   and   b   is the length of the cross product:   | a   ×   b | . (b) The volume of the parallelepiped determined by   a ,   b , and   c   is the magnitude of their scalar triple product:   | a   ·   ( b   ×   c ) | .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

A normal vector, which is perpendicular to the plane, is   h d> e> f i   (or any scalar multiple of   h d> e> f i ). If an equation is not known, we can use points on the plane to   fi nd two non-parallel vectors which lie in the plane. The cross product of these vectors is a vector perpendicular to the plane.  12.   The angle between two intersecting planes is de fi ned as the acute angle between their normal vectors. We can   fi nd this angle using Corollary 12.3.6.  13.   See (1), (2), and (3) in Section 12.5.  14.   See (5), (6), and (7) in Section 12.5.  15.   (a) Two (nonzero) vectors are parallel if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other. In addition, two nonzero vectors are parallel if and only if their cross product is   0 . (b) Two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is   0 . (c) Two planes are parallel if and only if their normal vectors are parallel.  16.   (a) Determine the vectors   3 3 <  S T   =   h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i   and   3 <  S U   =   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i . If there is a scalar   w   such that  h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i   =   w   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i , then the vectors are parallel and the points must all lie on the same line. Alternatively, if   3 3 <  S T   ×   3 <  S U   =   0 , then   3 3 <  S T   and   3 <  S U   are parallel, so   S   ,   T , and   U   are collinear. Thirdly, an algebraic method is to determine an equation of the line joining two of the points, and then check whether or not the third point satis fi es this equation. (b) Find the vectors   3 3 <  S T   =   a ,   3 <  S U   =   b ,   3 <  S V   =   c .   a   ×   b   is normal to the plane formed by   S   ,   T   and   U , and so   V   lies on this plane if   a   ×   b   and   c   are orthogonal, that is, if   ( a   ×   b )   ·   c   = 0 . (Or use the reasoning in Example 5 in Section 12.4.) Alternatively,   fi nd an equation for the plane determined by three of the points and check whether or not the fourth point satis fi es this equation.  17.   (a) See Exercise 12.4.45. (b) See Example 8 in Section 12.5. (c) See Example 10 in Section 12.5.  18.   The traces of a surface are the curves of intersection of the surface with planes parallel to the coordinate planes. We can   fi nd the trace in the plane   {   =   n   (parallel to the   |} -plane) by setting   {   =   n   and determining the curve represented by the resulting equation. Traces in the planes   |   =   n   (parallel to the   {} -plane) and   }   =   n   (parallel to the   {| -plane) are found similarly.  19.   See Table 1 in Section 12.6.  1.   This is false, as the dot product of two vectors is a scalar, not a vector.  2.   False. For example, if   u   =   i   and   v   =   3 i   then   | u   +   v |   =   | 0 |   = 0   but   | u |   +   | v |   = 1 + 1 = 2 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For example, if   u   =   i   and   v   =   j   then   | u   ·   v |   =   | 0 |   = 0   but   | u | | v |   = 1   ·   1 = 1 . In fact, by Theorem 12.3.3,  | u   ·   v |   =     | u | | v |   cos      .  4.   False. For example,   | i   ×   i |   =   | 0 |   = 0   (see Example 12.4.2) but   | i | | i |   = 1   ·   1 = 1 . In fact, by Thereom 12.4.9,  | u   ×   v |   =   | u | | v |   sin    .  5.   True, by Theorem 12.3.2, property 2.  6.   False. Property 1 of Theorem 12.4.11 says that   u   ×   v   =   3 v   ×   u .  7.   True. If      is the angle between   u   and   v , then by Theorem 12.4.9,   | u   ×   v |   =   | u | | v |   sin      =   | v | | u |   sin      =   | v   ×   u | . (Or, by Theorem 12.4.11,   | u   ×   v |   =   | 3 v   ×   u |   =   | 3 1 | | v   ×   u |   =   | v   ×   u | .)  8.   This is true by Theorem 12.3.2, property 4.  9.   Theorem 12.4.11, property 2 tells us that this is true.  10.   This is true by Theorem 12.4.11, property 4.  11.   This is true by Theorem 12.4.11, property 5.  12.   In general, this assertion is false; a counterexample is   i   ×   ( i   ×   j )   6   = ( i   ×   i )   ×   j . (See the paragraph preceding Theorem 12.4.11.)  13.   This is true because   u   ×   v   is orthogonal to   u   (see Theorem 12.4.8), and the dot product of two orthogonal vectors is   0 .  14.   ( u   +   v )   ×   v   =   u   ×   v   +   v   ×   v   [by Theorem 12.4.11, property 4]  =   u   ×   v   +   0   [by Example 12.4.2]  =   u   ×   v , so this is true.  15.   This is false. A normal vector to the plane is   n   =   h 6 >   3 2 >   4 i . Because   h 3 >   3 1 >   2 i   =   1 2   n , the vector is parallel to   n   and hence perpendicular to the plane.  16.   This is false, because according to Equation 12.5.8,   d{   +   e|   +   f}   +   g   = 0   is the general equation of a plane.  17.   This is false. In   R 2 ,   { 2   +   | 2   = 1   represents a circle, but   ( {> |> } )   |   { 2   +   | 2   = 1   represents a   three-dimensional surface , namely, a circular cylinder with axis the   } -axis.  18.   This is false. In   R 3   the graph of   |   =   { 2   is a parabolic cylinder (see Example 12.6.1). A paraboloid has an equation such as  }   =   { 2   +   | 2 .  19.   False. For example,   i   ·   j   =   0   but   i   6   =   0   and   j   6   =   0 .  20.   This is false. By Corollary 12.4.10,   u   ×   v   =   0   for any nonzero parallel vectors   u ,   v . For instance,   i   ×   i   =   0 .  21.   This is true. If   u   and   v   are both nonzero, then by (7) in Section 12.3,   u   ·   v   = 0   implies that   u   and   v   are orthogonal. But  u   ×   v   =   0   implies that   u   and   v   are parallel (see Corollary 12.4.10). Two nonzero vectors can’t be both parallel and orthogonal, so at least one of   u ,   v   must be   0 .  22.   This is true. We know   u   ·   v   =   | u | | v |   cos      where   | u |   D   0 ,   | v |   D   0 , and   | cos    |   $   1 , so   | u   ·   v |   =   | u | | v | | cos    |   $   | u | | v | .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(a) The radius of the sphere is the distance between the points   ( 3 1 >   2 >   1)   and   (6 >   3 2 >   3) , namely,  s [6   3   ( 3 1)] 2   + ( 3 2   3   2) 2   + (3   3   1) 2   =   I 69 . By the formula for an equation of a sphere (see page 813 [ET 789]), an equation of the sphere with center   ( 3 1 >   2 >   1)   and radius   I 69   is   ( {   + 1) 2   + ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   = 69 . (b) The intersection of this sphere with the   |} -plane is the set of points on the sphere whose   { -coordinate is   0 . Putting   {   = 0  into the equation, we have   ( |   3   2) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   = 68 > {   = 0   which represents a circle in the   |} -plane with center   (0 >   2 >   1)  and radius   I 68 .

We know that the cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to both.

The line has direction   v   =   h 3 3 >   2 >   3 i . Letting   S 0   = (4 >   3 1 >   2) , parametric equations are  {   = 4   3   3 w ,   |   =   3 1 + 2 w ,   }   = 2 + 3 w .  16.   A direction vector for the line is   v   =   h 3 >   2 >   1 i , so parametric equations for the line are   {   = 1 + 3 w ,   |   = 2 w ,   }   =   3 1 +   w .  17.   A direction vector for the line is a normal vector for the plane,   n   =   h 2 >   3 1 >   5 i , and parametric equations for the line are  {   =   3 2 + 2 w ,   |   = 2   3   w ,   }   = 4 + 5 w .  18.   Since the two planes are parallel, they will have the same normal vectors. Then we can take   n   =   h 1 >   4 >   3 3 i   and an equation of the plane is   1( {   3   2) + 4( |   3   1)   3   3( }   3   0) = 0   or   {   + 4 |   3   3 }   = 6 .  19.   Here the vectors   a   =   h 4   3   3 >   0   3   ( 3 1)   >   2   3   1 i   =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   and   b   =   h 6   3   3 >   3   3   ( 3 1) >   1   3   1 i   =   h 3 >   4 >   0 i   lie in the plane, so   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 3 4 >   3 >   1 i   is a normal vector to the plane and an equation of the plane is  3 4( {   3   3) + 3( |   3   ( 3 1)) + 1( }   3   1) = 0   or   3 4 {   + 3 |   +   }   =   3 14 .  20.   If we   fi rst   fi nd two nonparallel vectors in the plane, their cross product will be a normal vector to the plane. Since the given line lies in the plane, its direction vector   a   =   h 2 >   3 1 >   3 i   is one vector in the plane. We can verify that the given point   (1 >   2 >   3 2)  does not lie on this line. The point   (0 >   3 >   1)   is on the line (obtained by putting   w   = 0 ) and hence in the plane, so the vector  b   =   h 0   3   1 >   3   3   2 >   1   3   ( 3 2) i   =   h 3 1 >   1 >   3 i   lies in the plane, and a normal vector is   n   =   a   ×   b   =   h 3 6 >   3 9 >   1 i . Thus an equation of the plane is   3 6( {   3   1)   3   9( |   3   2) + ( }   + 2) = 0   or   6 {   + 9 |   3   }   = 26 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Substitution of the parametric equations into the equation of the plane gives   2 {   3   |   +   }   = 2(2   3   w )   3   (1 + 3 w ) + 4 w   = 2   i 3 w   + 3 = 2   i   w   = 1 . When   w   = 1 , the parametric equations give   {   = 2   3   1 = 1 ,   |   = 1 + 3 = 4   and   }   = 4 . Therefore, the point of intersection is   (1 >   4 >   4) .  22.   Use the formula proven in Exercise 12.4.45(a). In the notation used in that exercise,   a   is just the direction of the line; that is,  a   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i . A point on the line is   (1 >   2 >   3 1)   (setting   w   = 0 ), and therefore   b   =   h 1   3   0 >   2   3   0 >   3 1   3   0 i   =   h 1 >   2 >   3 1 i . Hence   g   =   | a   ×   b | | a |   =   |h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i × h 1 >   2 >   3 1 i|  I 1 + 1 + 4   =   |h 3 3 >   3 >   3 i|  I 6   =  u   27 6   =   3  I 2   .  23.   Since the direction vectors   h 2 >   3 >   4 i   and   h 6 >   3 1 >   2 i   aren’t parallel, neither are the lines. For the lines to intersect, the three equations   1 + 2 w   =   3 1 + 6 v ,   2 + 3 w   = 3   3   v ,   3 + 4 w   =   3 5 + 2 v   must be satis fi ed simultaneously. Solving the   fi rst two equations gives   w   =   1 5   ,   v   =   2 5   and checking we see these values don’t satisfy the third equation. Thus the lines aren’t parallel and they don’t intersect, so they must be skew.  24.   (a) The normal vectors are   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i   and   h 2 >   3 3 >   4 i . Since these vectors aren’t parallel, neither are the planes parallel. Also   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i · h 2 >   3 3 >   4 i   = 2   3   3   3   4 =   3 5   6   = 0   so the normal vectors, and thus the planes, are not perpendicular. (b)   cos      =   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i · h 2 >   3 3 >   4 i  I 3   I 29   =   3   5  I 87   and      = cos 3 1    3   5 I 87    E   122    [or we can say   E   58  ].  25.   n 1   =   h 1 >   0 >   3 1 i   and   n 2   =   h 0 >   1 >   2 i . Setting   }   = 0 , it is easy to see that   (1 >   3 >   0)   is a point on the line of intersection of  {   3   }   = 1   and   |   + 2 }   = 3 . The direction of this line is   v 1   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   3 2 >   1 i . A second vector parallel to the desired plane is   v 2   =   h 1 >   1 >   3 2 i , since it is perpendicular to   {   +   |   3   2 }   = 1 . Therefore, the normal of the plane in question is  n   =   v 1   ×   v 2   =   h 4   3   1 >   1 + 2 >   1 + 2 i   = 3   h 1 >   1 >   1 i . Taking   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) = (1 >   3 >   0) , the equation we are looking for is  ( {   3   1) + ( |   3   3) +   }   = 0   C   {   +   |   +   }   = 4 .  26.   (a) The vectors   3 <  DE   =   h 3 1   3   2 >   3 1   3   1 >   10   3   1 i   =   h 3 3 >   3 2 >   9 i   and   3 <  DF   =   h 1   3   2 >   3   3   1 >   3 4   3   1 i   =   h 3 1 >   2 >   3 5 i   lie in the plane, so   n   =   3 <  DE   ×   3 <  DF   =   h 3 3 >   3 2 >   9 i × h 3 1 >   2 >   3 5 i   =   h 3 8 >   3 24 >   3 8 i   or equivalently   h 1 >   3 >   1 i   is a normal vector to the plane. The point   D (2 >   1 >   1)   lies on the plane so an equation of the plane is   1( {   3   2) + 3( |   3   1) + 1( }   3   1) = 0   or  {   + 3 |   +   }   = 6 . (b) The line is perpendicular to the plane so it is parallel to a normal vector for the plane, namely   h 1 >   3 >   1 i . If the line passes through   E ( 3 1 >   3 1 >   10)   then symmetric equations are   {   3   ( 3 1) 1   =   |   3   ( 3 1) 3   =   }   3   10 1   or   {   + 1 =   |   + 1 3   =   }   3   10 . (c) Normal vectors for the two planes are   n 1   =   h 1 >   3 >   1 i   and   n 2   =   h 2 >   3 4 >   3 3 i . The angle      between the planes is given by  cos      =   n 1   ·   n 2  | n 1 | | n 2 |   =   h 1 >   3 >   1 i · h 2 >   3 4 >   3 3 i  I 1 2   + 3 2   + 1 2   s 2 2   + ( 3 4) 2   + ( 3 3) 2   =  2   3   12   3   3  I 11   I 29   =   3   13  I 319  Thus      = cos 3 1    3   13  I 319    E   137    or   180    3   137    = 43  .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

A vector   v   in the direction of this intersecting line is perpendicular to the normal vectors of both planes, so take   v   =   n 1   ×   n 2   =   h 1 >   3 >   1 i × h 2 >   3 4 >   3 3 i   =   h 3 5 >   5 >   3 10 i   or equivalently we can take   v   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i . Parametric equations for the line are   {   = 2 +   w ,   |   =   3 w ,   }   = 4 + 2 w .  27.   By Exercise 12.5.75,   G   =   | 3 2   3   ( 3 24) |  s 3 2   + 1 2   + ( 3 4) 2   =   22  I 26   .  28.   The equation   {   = 3   represents a plane parallel to the  |} -plane and   3   units in front of it.  29.   The equation   {   =   }   represents a plane perpendicular to the   {} -plane and intersecting the   {} -plane in the line  {   =   } ,   |   = 0 .  30.   The equation   |   =   } 2   represents a parabolic cylinder whose trace in the   {} -plane is the   { -axis and which opens to the right.  31.   The equation   { 2   =   | 2   + 4 } 2   represents a (right elliptical) cone with vertex at the origin and axis the   { -axis.  32.   4 {   3   |   + 2 }   = 4   is a plane with intercepts  (1 >   0 >   0) ,   (0 >   3 4 >   0) , and   (0 >   0 >   2) .  33.   An equivalent equation is   3 { 2   +   | 2  4   3   } 2   = 1 , a hyperboloid of two sheets with axis the   | -axis. For  | | |   A   2 , traces parallel to the   {} -plane are circles.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Completing the square in   |   gives  4 { 2   + 4( |   3   1) 2   +   } 2   = 4   or   { 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   +   } 2  4   = 1 , an ellipsoid centered at   (0 >   1 >   0) .  36.

The equation of the ellipsoid is   { 2  4   +   | 2  16  +   } 2  f 2   = 1 , since the horizontal trace in the plane   }   = 0   must be the original ellipse. The traces of the ellipsoid in the   |} -plane must be circles since the surface is obtained by rotation about the   { -axis. Therefore,   f 2   = 16   and the equation of the ellipsoid is   { 2  4   +   | 2  16  +   } 2  16  = 1   C  4 { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   = 16 .  38.

Since three-dimensional situations are often dif fi cult to visualize and work with, let us   fi rst try to   fi nd an analogous problem in two dimensions. The analogue of a cube is a square and the analogue of a sphere is a circle. Thus a similar problem in two dimensions is the following: if   fi ve circles with the same radius   u   are contained in a square of side   1   m so that the circles touch each other and four of the circles touch two sides of the square,   fi nd   u . The diagonal of the square is   I 2 . The diagonal is also   4 u   + 2 { . But   {   is the diagonal of a smaller square of side   u . Therefore  {   =   I 2   u   i   I 2 = 4 u   + 2 {   = 4 u   + 2   I 2   u   =    4 + 2   I 2    u   i   u   =   I 2 4 + 2   I 2   . Let’s use these ideas to solve the original three-dimensional problem. The diagonal of the cube is   I 1 2   + 1 2   + 1 2   =   I 3 . The diagonal of the cube is also   4 u   + 2 {   where   {   is the diagonal of a smaller cube with edge   u . Therefore  {   =   I u 2   +   u 2   +   u 2   =   I 3   u   i   I 3 = 4 u   + 2 {   = 4 u   + 2   I 3   u   =    4 + 2   I 3    u . Thus   u   =  I 3 4 + 2   I 3  =  2   I 3   3   3 2   . The radius of each ball is    I 3   3   3 2     m.  2.   Try an analogous problem in two dimensions. Consider a rectangle with length   O   and width   Z   and   fi nd the area of   V   in terms of   O   and   Z   . Since   V  contains   E , it has area  D ( V ) =   OZ   +   the area of two   O   ×   1   rectangles  +   the area of two   1   ×   Z   rectangles  +   the area of four quarter-circles of radius   1  as seen in the diagram. So   D ( V ) =   OZ   + 2 O   + 2 Z   +      ·   1 2 . Now in three dimensions, the volume of   V   is  OZ K   + 2( O   ×   Z   ×   1) + 2(1   ×   Z   ×   K ) + 2( O   ×   1   ×   K ) +   the volume of   4   quarter-cylinders with radius   1   and height   Z  +   the volume of   4   quarter-cylinders with radius   1   and height   O  +   the volume of   4   quarter-cylinders with radius   1   and height   K  +   the volume of   8   eighths of a sphere of radius   1  So  Y   ( V ) =   OZ K   + 2 OZ   + 2 Z K   + 2 OK   +      ·   1 2   ·   Z   +      ·   1 2   ·   O   +      ·   1 2   ·   K   +   4 3      ·   1 3  =   OZ K   + 2( OZ   +   Z K   +   OK ) +    ( O   +   Z   +   K ) +   4 3   =  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Observe that the point   ( 3 1 > f> f )   lies on both planes. Now since  O   lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of the normal vectors   n 1   and   n 2 , and thus parallel to their cross product  n 1   ×   n 2   =          i   j   k  f   1   1 1   3 f   f          =   2 f>   3 f 2   + 1 >   3 f 2   3   1  . So symmetric equations of   O   can be written as  {   + 1  3 2 f   =   |   3   f f 2   3   1  =   }   3   f f 2   + 1   , provided that   f   6   = 0 ,   ± 1 . If   f   = 0 , then the two planes are given by   |   +   }   = 0   and   {   =   3 1 , so symmetric equations of   O   are   {   =   3 1 ,   |   =   3 } . If  f   =   3 1 , then the two planes are given by   3 {   +   |   +   }   =   3 1   and   {   +   |   +   }   =   3 1 , and they intersect in the line   {   = 0 ,  |   =   3 }   3   1 . If   f   = 1 , then the two planes are given by   {   +   |   +   }   = 1   and   {   3   |   +   }   = 1 , and they intersect in the line  |   = 0 ,   {   = 1   3   } . (b) If we set   }   =   w   in the symmetric equations and solve for   {   and   |   separately, we get   {   + 1 =  ( w   3   f )( 3 2 f )  f 2   + 1   ,  |   3   f   =  ( w   3   f )( f 2   3   1)  f 2   + 1   i   {   =   3 2 fw   + ( f 2   3   1)  f 2   + 1   ,   |   =  ( f 2   3   1) w   + 2 f f 2   + 1   . Eliminating   f   from these equations, we have   { 2   +   | 2   =   w 2   + 1 . So the curve traced out by   O   in the plane   }   =   w   is a circle with center at   (0 >   0 > w )   and radius   I w 2   + 1 . (c) The area of a horizontal cross-section of the solid is   D ( } ) =    ( } 2   + 1) , so   Y   =   U   1 0   D ( } ) g}   =       1 3   } 3   +   }  1 0   =   4   3   .  4.   (a) We consider velocity vectors for the plane and the wind. Let   v l   be the initial, intended velocity for the plane and   v j   the actual velocity relative to the ground. If   w   is the velocity of the wind,   v j   is the resultant, that is, the vector sum   v l   +   w   as shown in the   fi gure. We know   v l   = 180   j , and since the plane actually   fl ew   80 km   in   1 2   hour,   | v j   |   = 160 . Thus  v j   = (160 cos 85  )   i   + (160 sin 85  )   j   E   13 = 9   i   + 159 = 4   j . Finally,   v l   +   w   =   v j   , so  w   =   v j   3   v l   E   13 = 9   i   3   20 = 6   j . Thus, the wind velocity is about   13 = 9   i   3   20 = 6   j , and the wind speed is   | w |   E   s (13 = 9) 2   + ( 3 20 = 6) 2   E   24 = 9 km @ h . (b) Let   v   be the velocity the pilot should have taken. The pilot would need to head a little west of north to compensate for the wind, so let      be the angle   v   makes with the north direction. Then we can write  v   =   h 180 cos(    + 90  ) >   180 sin(    + 90  ) i . With the effect of the wind, the actual velocity (with respect to the ground) will be   v   +   w , which we want to be due north.

The distance from   S   to   T   ( 3 1 >   1 >   4)   is   I 4 + 1 + 1 =   I 6 , so the largest possible sphere that passes through   T   and satis fi es the stated conditions extends   5   I 6   units in the opposite direction, giving a diameter of  6   I 6 . (See the   fi gure.) Thus the radius of the desired sphere is   3   I 6 , and its center is   3   I 6   units from   T   in the direction of   S   . A unit vector in this direction is   u   =   1 I 6   h 2 >   1 >   3 1 i , so starting at   T ( 3 1 >   1 >   4)   and following the vector   3   I 6   u   =   h 6 >   3 >   3 3 i   we arrive at the center of the sphere,   (5 >   4 >   1) .

Since the vectors form a right triangle, we have  tan(  v ) =   | F | | N |   =    v q q   =    v . (b) We place the block at the origin and sketch the force vectors acting on the block, including the additional horizontal force  H , with initial points at the origin. We then rotate this system so that   F   lies along the positive   { -axis and the inclined plane is parallel to the   { -axis. (See the following   fi gure.)  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Note for      =    v ,   k min   =   pj   tan 0 = 0 , which makes sense since the block is at rest for    v , thus no additional force   H  is necessary to prevent it from moving. As      increases, the factor   tan(    3    v ) , and hence the value of   k min , increases slowly for small values of      3    v   but much more rapidly as      3    v   becomes signi fi cant. This seems reasonable, as the steeper the inclined plane, the less the horizontal components of the various forces affect the movement of the block, so we would need a much larger magnitude of horizontal force to keep the block motionless. If we allow      <   90  , corresponding to the inclined plane being placed vertically, the value of   k min   is quite large; this is to be expected, as it takes a great amount of horizontal force to keep an object from moving vertically. In fact, without friction (so    v   = 0 ), we would have     <   90    i   k min   < " , and it would be impossible to keep the block from slipping.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Our system of forces is similar to that in part (b), then, except that we have   F   =   3 (  v q )   i . (Note that   | F |   is again maximal.) Following our procedure in parts (b) and (c), we equate components:  3  v q   3   pj   sin      +   k max   cos      = 0   i   k max   cos      3    v q   =   pj   sin    q   3   pj   cos      3   k max   sin      = 0   i   k max   sin      +   pj   cos      =   q  Then substituting,  k max   cos      3    v ( k max   sin      +   pj   cos    ) =   pj   sin      i  k max   cos      3   k max  v   sin      =   pj   sin      +   pj v   cos      i  k max   =   pj     sin      +    v   cos     cos      3    v   sin       =   pj     tan      +    v  1   3    v   tan       =   pj     tan      + tan    v  1   3   tan    v   tan       =   pj   tan(    +    v )  We would expect   k max   to increase as      increases, with similar behavior as we established for   k min , but with   k max   values always larger than   k min . We can see that this is the case if we graph   k max   as a function of    , as the curve is the graph of  k min   translated   2  v   to the left, so the equation does seem reasonable. Notice that the equation predicts   k max   < "   as     <   (90    3    v ) . In fact, as   k max   increases, the normal force increases as well. When   (90    3    v )   $      $   90  , the horizontal force is completely counteracted by the sum of the normal and frictional forces, so no part of the horizontal force contributes to moving the block up the plane no matter how large its magnitude.  8.   (a) The largest possible solid is achieved by starting with a circular cylinder of diameter 1 with axis the   } -axis and with a height of 1. This is the largest solid that creates a square shadow with side length 1 in the   | -direction and a circular disk shadow in the   } -direction. For convenience, we place the base of the cylinder on the   {| -plane so that it intersects the   { - and   | -axes at   ±   1 2   . We then remove as little as possible from the solid that leaves an isosceles triangle shadow in the   { -direction. This is achieved by cutting the solid with planes parallel to the   { -axis that intersect the  } -axis at 1 and the   | -axis at   ±   1 2   (see the   fi gure).  To compute the volume of this solid, we take vertical slices parallel to the   {} -plane. The equation of the base of the solid is   { 2   +   | 2   =   1 4   , so a cross-section   |   units to the right of the origin is a rectangle with base   2  t   1 4   3   | 2 . For   0   $   |   $   1 2   , the solid is cut off on top by the plane   }   = 1   3   2 | , so the height of the rectangular cross-section is   1   3   2 |   and the  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The corresponding parametric equations are   {   = sin   w ,   |   =   w ,   }   = cos   w . Note that   { 2   +   } 2   = sin 2   w   + cos 2   w   = 1 , so the curve lies on the circular cylinder   { 2   +   } 2   = 1 .

These are positive for   w   6   = 0   and   0   when   w   = 0 . So the curve lies entirely in the   fi rst octant. The projection of the graph onto the   {| -plane is   |   =   { 2 ,   | A   0 , a half parabola.

If   {   = cos   w ,   |   =   3   cos   w ,   }   = sin   w , then   { 2   +   } 2   = 1   and   | 2   +   } 2   = 1 , so the curve is contained in the intersection of circular cylinders along the  { - and   | -axes. Furthermore,   |   =   3 { , so the curve is an ellipse in the plane   |   =   3 { , centered at the origin.  15.

A point   ( {> |> } )   on the curve lies directly above or below   ( {> |>   0) , which moves around the unit circle in the   {| -plane with period   2  . At the same time, the   } -value of the point   ( {> |> } )   oscillates with a period of    . So the curve repeats itself and the graph is I.  25.   {   = cos 8 w ,   |   = sin 8 w ,   }   =   h 0 = 8 w ,   w   D   0 .   { 2   +   | 2   = cos 2   8 w   + sin 2   8 w   = 1 , so the curve lies on a circular cylinder with axis the   } -axis.

The curve starts at   (1 >   0 >   1) , when   w   = 0 , and   }   < "   (at an increasing rate) as  w   < " , so the graph is IV.  26.   {   = cos 2   w ,   |   = sin 2   w ,   }   =   w .   {   +   |   = cos 2   w   + sin 2   w   = 1 , so the curve lies in the vertical plane   {   +   |   = 1 .  {   and   |   are periodic, both with period    , and   }   increases as   w   increases, so the graph is III.  27.

Since   }   =   w , the curve is a spiral on this cone.  28.   Here   { 2   = sin 2   w   =   }   and   { 2   +   | 2   = sin 2   w   + cos 2   w   = 1 , so the curve is contained in the intersection of the parabolic cylinder  }   =   { 2   with the circular cylinder   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 .

Since   r (0) =   0   and   r (1) =   i   +   k , the points of intersection are   (0 >   0 >   0)   and   (1 >   0 >   1) .  30.   Parametric equations for the helix are   {   = sin   w ,   |   = cos   w ,   }   =   w . Substituting into the equation of the sphere gives  sin 2   w   + cos 2   w   +   w 2   = 5   i   1 +   w 2   = 5   i   w   =   ± 2 .

From the graph at left, we see that this curve looks like the projection of a leaved two-dimensional curve onto a cone.  38.   {   =   I 1   3   0 = 25 cos 2   10 w   cos   w ,   |   =   I 1   3   0 = 25 cos 2   10 w   sin   w ,  }   = 0 = 5 cos 10 w .

We get the complete graph for   0   $   w   $   2  .  39.   If   w   =   3 1 , then   {   = 1 ,   |   = 4 ,   }   = 0 , so the curve passes through the point   (1 >   4 >   0) . If   w   = 3 , then   {   = 9 ,   |   =   3 8 ,   }   = 28 , so the curve passes through the point   (9 >   3 8 >   28) . For the point   (4 >   7 >   3 6)   to be on the curve, we require   |   = 1   3   3 w   = 7   i  w   =   3 2 =   But then   }   = 1 + ( 3 2) 3   =   3 7   6   =   3 6 , so   (4 >   7 >   3 6)   is not on the curve.  40.   The projection of the curve   F   of intersection onto the   {| -plane is the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 ,   }   = 0 .

Then parametric equations for   F   are   {   =   w ,   |   =   w 2 ,   }   = 4 w 2   +   w 4 , and the corresponding vector function is   r ( w ) =   w   i   +   w 2   j   + (4 w 2   +   w 4 )   k .  43.   The projection of the curve   F   of intersection onto the   {| -plane is the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 ,   }   = 0 , so we can write   {   = cos   w ,  |   = sin   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  .

The projection of the curve   F   of intersection onto the  {| -plane is the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 > }   = 0 . Then we can write  {   = 2 cos   w ,   |   = 2 sin   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  . Since   F   also lies on the surface   }   =   { 2 , we have   }   =   { 2   = (2 cos   w ) 2   = 4 cos 2   w . Then parametric equations for   F   are   {   = 2 cos   w ,   |   = 2 sin   w ,  }   = 4 cos 2   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  .  46.  {   =   w   i   |   =   w 2   i   4 } 2   = 16   3   { 2   3   4 | 2   = 16   3   w 2   3   4 w 4   i   }   =  t  4   3      1 2   w  2   3   w 4 . Note that   }   is positive because the intersection is with the top half of the ellipsoid. Hence the curve is given by   {   =   w ,   |   =   w 2 ,   }   =  t  4   3   1 4   w 2   3   w 4 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

For the particles to collide, we require   r 1 ( w ) =   r 2 ( w )   C   w 2 >   7 w   3   12 > w 2    =   4 w   3   3 > w 2 >   5 w   3   6  . Equating components gives   w 2   = 4 w   3   3 ,   7 w   3   12 =   w 2 , and   w 2   = 5 w   3   6 . From the   fi rst equation,   w 2   3   4 w   + 3 = 0   C   ( w   3   3)( w   3   1) = 0   so   w   = 1  or   w   = 3 .   w   = 1   does not satisfy the other two equations, but   w   = 3   does. The particles collide when   w   = 3 , at the point   (9 >   9 >   9) .  48.   The particles collide provided   r 1 ( w ) =   r 2 ( w )   C   w> w 2 > w 3    =   h 1 + 2 w>   1 + 6 w>   1 + 14 w i . Equating components gives  w   = 1 + 2 w ,   w 2   = 1 + 6 w , and   w 3   = 1 + 14 w . The   fi rst equation gives   w   =   3 1 , but this does not satisfy the other equations, so the particles do not collide. For the paths to intersect, we need to   fi nd a value for   w   and a value for   v   where   r 1 ( w ) =   r 2 ( v )   C  w> w 2 > w 3    =   h 1 + 2 v>   1 + 6 v>   1 + 14 v i . Equating components,   w   = 1 + 2 v ,   w 2   = 1 + 6 v , and   w 3   = 1 + 14 v . Substituting the  fi rst equation into the second gives   (1 + 2 v ) 2   = 1 + 6 v   i   4 v 2   3   2 v   = 0   i   2 v (2 v   3   1) = 0   i   v   = 0   or   v   =   1 2   . From the   fi rst equation,   v   = 0   i   w   = 1   and   v   =   1 2   i   w   = 2 . Checking, we see that both pairs of values satisfy the third equation. Thus the paths intersect twice, at the point   (1 >   1 >   1)   when   v   = 0   and   w   = 1 , and at   (2 >   4 >   8)   when   v   =   1 2  and   w   = 2 .  49.   Let   u ( w ) =   h x 1 ( w ) > x 2 ( w ) > x 3 ( w ) i   and   v ( w ) =   h y 1 ( w ) > y 2 ( w ) > y 3 ( w ) i . In each part of this problem the basic procedure is to use Equation 1 and then analyze the individual component functions using the limit properties we have already developed for real-valued functions. (a)   lim  w < d   u ( w ) + lim  w < d   v ( w ) =  G  lim  w < d   x 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 3 ( w )  H  +  G  lim  w < d   y 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   y 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   y 3 ( w )  H  and the limits of these component functions must each exist since the vector functions both possess limits as   w   <   d . Then adding the two vectors and using the addition property of limits for real-valued functions, we have that  lim  w < d   u ( w ) + lim  w < d   v ( w ) =  G  lim  w < d   x 1 ( w ) + lim  w < d   y 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 2 ( w ) + lim  w < d   y 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 3 ( w ) + lim  w < d   y 3 ( w )  H  =  G  lim  w < d   [ x 1 ( w ) +   y 1 ( w )]   >   lim  w < d   [ x 2 ( w ) +   y 2 ( w )]   >   lim  w < d   [ x 3 ( w ) +   y 3 ( w )]  H  = lim  w < d   h x 1 ( w ) +   y 1 ( w ) > x 2 ( w ) +   y 2 ( w ) > x 3 ( w ) +   y 3 ( w ) i   [using (1) backward]  = lim  w < d   [ u ( w ) +   v ( w )]  (b)   lim  w < d   f u ( w ) = lim  w < d   h fx 1 ( w ) > fx 2 ( w ) > fx 3 ( w ) i   =  G  lim  w < d   fx 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   fx 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   fx 3 ( w )  H  =  G  f   lim  w < d   x 1 ( w ) > f   lim  w < d   x 2 ( w ) > f   lim  w < d   x 3 ( w )  H  =   f  G  lim  w < d   x 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 3 ( w )  H  =   f   lim  w < d   h x 1 ( w ) > x 2 ( w ) > x 3 ( w ) i   =   f   lim  w < d   u ( w )  (c)   lim  w < d   u ( w )   ·   lim  w < d   v ( w ) =  G  lim  w < d   x 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   x 3 ( w )  H  ·  G  lim  w < d   y 1 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   y 2 ( w ) >   lim  w < d   y 3 ( w )  H  =  k  lim  w < d   x 1 ( w )  l k  lim  w < d   y 1 ( w )  l  +  k  lim  w < d   x 2 ( w )  l k  lim  w < d   y 2 ( w )  l  +  k  lim  w < d   x 3 ( w )  l k  lim  w < d   y 3 ( w )  l  = lim  w < d   x 1 ( w ) y 1 ( w ) + lim  w < d   x 2 ( w ) y 2 ( w ) + lim  w < d   x 3 ( w ) y 3 ( w ) = lim  w < d   [ x 1 ( w ) y 1 ( w ) +   x 2 ( w ) y 2 ( w ) +   x 3 ( w ) y 3 ( w )] = lim  w < d   [ u ( w )   ·   v ( w )]  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The projection of the curve onto the   {| -plane is given by the parametric equations   {   = (2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) cos   w ,  |   = (2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) sin   w . If we convert to polar coordinates, we have  u 2   =   { 2   +   | 2   = [(2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) cos   w ] 2   + [(2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) sin   w ] 2   = (2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) 2 (cos 2   w   + sin 2   w ) = (2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) 2   i  u   = 2 + cos 1 = 5 w . Also,   tan      =   | {   =  (2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) sin   w  (2 + cos 1 = 5 w ) cos   w   = tan   w   i      =   w . Thus the polar equation of the curve is   u   = 2 + cos 1 = 5  . At      = 0 , we have  u   = 3 , and   u   decreases to   1   as      increases to   2   3   . For   2   3   $      $   4   3   ,   u  increases to   3 ;   u   decreases to   1   again at      = 2  , increases to   3   at      =   8   3   , decreases to   1   at      =   10   3   , and completes the closed curve by increasing to   3   at      = 4  . We sketch an approximate graph as shown in the   fi gure. We can determine how the curve passes over itself by investigating the maximum and minimum values of   }   for   0   $   w   $   4  . Since   }   = sin 1 = 5 w ,   }   is maximized where   sin 1 = 5 w   = 1   i   1 = 5 w   =     2   ,   5   2   , or   9   2   i  w   =     3   ,   5   3   , or   3  .   }   is minimized where   sin 1 = 5 w   =   3 1   i  1 = 5 w   =   3   2   ,   7   2   , or   11   2   i   w   =    ,   7   3   , or   11   3   . Note that these are precisely the values for which   cos 1 = 5 w   = 0   i   u   = 2 , and on the graph of the projection, these six points appear to be at the three self-intersections we see. Comparing the maximum and minimum values of   }   at these intersections, we can determine where the curve passes over itself, as indicated in the   fi gure.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The vector equation for the curve is   r ( w ) =   1 + 2   I w> w 3   3   w> w 3   +   w  , so   r 0 ( w ) =   1 @ I w>   3 w 2   3   1 >   3 w 2   + 1  . The point  (3 >   0 >   2)   corresponds to   w   = 1 , so the tangent vector there is   r 0 (1) =   h 1 >   2 >   4 i . Thus, the tangent line goes through the point  (3 >   0 >   2)   and is parallel to the vector   h 1 >   2 >   4 i . Parametric equations are   {   = 3 +   w ,   |   = 2 w ,   }   = 2 + 4 w .  24.   The vector equation for the curve is   r ( w ) =  G  h w > wh w > wh w 2   H  , so   r 0 ( w ) =  G  h w > wh w   +   h w >   2 w 2 h w 2  +   h w 2   H  . The point   (1 >   0 >   0)  corresponds to   w   = 0 , so the tangent vector there is   r 0 (0) =   h 1 >   1 >   1 i . Thus, the tangent line is parallel to the vector   h 1 >   1 >   1 i  and includes the point   (1 >   0 >   0) .

The vector equation for the curve is   r ( w ) =   h 3 w   cos   w> h 3 w   sin   w> h 3 w  , so  r 0 ( w ) =   h 3 w ( 3   sin   w ) + (cos   w )( 3 h 3 w ) ,   h 3 w   cos   w   + (sin   w )( 3 h 3 w ) ,   ( 3 h 3 w )   =   3 h 3 w (cos   w   + sin   w ) > h 3 w (cos   w   3   sin   w ) >   3 h 3 w   The point   (1 >   0 >   1)   corresponds to   w   = 0 , so the tangent vector there is  r 0 (0) =   3 h 0 (cos 0 + sin 0) > h 0 (cos 0   3   sin 0) >   3 h 0    =   h 3 1 >   1 >   3 1 i . Thus, the tangent line is parallel to the vector  h 3 1 >   1 >   3 1 i   and parametric equations are   {   = 1 + ( 3 1) w   = 1   3   w ,   |   = 0 + 1   ·   w   =   w ,   }   = 1 + ( 3 1) w   = 1   3   w .  26.   The vector equation for the curve is   r ( w ) =   I w 2   + 3 >   ln( w 2   + 3) > w  , so   r 0 ( w ) =   w@ I w 2   + 3 >   2 w@ ( w 2   + 3) >   1  .

The projection of   F   onto the   {| -plane is contained in the circle  { 2   +   | 2   = 25 ,   }   = 0 , so we can write   {   = 5 cos   w ,   |   = 5 sin   w .   F   also lies on the cylinder   | 2   +   } 2   = 20 , and   }   D   0  near the point   (3 >   4 >   2) , so we can write   }   =   s 20   3   | 2   =   s 20   3   25 sin 2   w .

The tangent line to the curve is parallel to the plane when the curve’s tangent vector is orthogonal to the plane’s normal vector.

So the equation of the second line is  h {> |> } i   =   h 1 >   2 >   0 i   +   y   h 0 >   0 >   3  i   =   h 1 >   2 >   3 y i . The lines intersect where   h x>   2 x>   1 i   =   h 1 >   2 >   3 y i , so the point of intersection is   (1 >   2 >   1) . (b)  33.   The angle of intersection of the two curves is the angle between the two tangent vectors to the curves at the point of intersection. Since   r 0  1 ( w ) =   1 >   2 w>   3 w 2    and   w   = 0   at   (0 >   0 >   0) ,   r 0  1 (0) =   h 1 >   0 >   0 i   is a tangent vector to   r 1   at   (0 >   0 >   0) . Similarly,  r 0  2 ( w ) =   h cos   w>   2 cos 2 w>   1 i   and since   r 2 (0) =   h 0 >   0 >   0 i ,   r 0  2   (0) =   h 1 >   2 >   1 i   is a tangent vector to   r 2   at   (0 >   0 >   0) . If      is the angle between these two tangent vectors, then   cos      =   1 I 1   I 6   h 1 >   0 >   0 i · h 1 >   2 >   1 i   =   1 I 6   and      = cos 3 1     1 I 6    E   66  .  34.   To   fi nd the point of intersection, we must   fi nd the values of   w   and   v   which satisfy the following three equations simultaneously:  w   = 3   3   v ,   1   3   w   =   v   3   2 ,   3 +   w 2   =   v 2 . Solving the last two equations gives   w   = 1 ,   v   = 2   (check these in the   fi rst equation). Thus the point of intersection is   (1 >   0 >   4) . To   fi nd the angle      of intersection, we proceed as in Exercise 33. The tangent vectors to the respective curves at   (1 >   0 >   4)   are   r 0  1 (1) =   h 1 >   3 1 >   2 i   and   r 0  2 (2) =   h 3 1 >   1 >   4 i . So  cos      =   1 I 6 I 18   ( 3 1   3   1 + 8) =   6 6 I 3   =   1 I 3   and      = cos 3 1     1 I 3    E   55  .  Note:   In Exercise 33, the curves intersect when the value of both parameters is zero. However, as seen in this exercise, it is not necessary for the parameters to be of equal value at the point of intersection.  35.

Thus   | r ( w ) | 2 , and so   | r ( w ) | , is a constant, and hence the curve lies on a sphere with center the origin.  55.   Since   u ( w ) =   r ( w )   ·   [ r 0 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w )] ,  u 0 ( w ) =   r 0 ( w )   ·   [ r 0 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w )] +   r ( w )   ·   g gw   [ r 0 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w )] = 0 +   r ( w )   ·   [ r 00 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w ) +   r 0 ( w )   ×   r 000 ( w )]   [since   r 0 ( w )   z   r 0 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w ) ]  =   r ( w )   ·   [ r 0 ( w )   ×   r 000 ( w )]   [since   r 00 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w ) =   0 ]  56.   The tangent vector   r 0 ( w )   is de fi ned as   lim  k < 0  r ( w   +   k )   3   r ( w )  k   . Here we assume that this limit exists and   r 0 ( w )   6   =   0 ; then we know that this vector lies on the tangent line to the curve. As in Figure 1, let points   S   and   T   have position vectors   r ( w )   and   r ( w   +   k ) . The vector   r ( w   +   k )   3   r ( w )   points from   S   to   T , so   r ( w   +   k )   3   r ( w ) =   3 3 <  S T . If   k A   0   then   w ? w   +   k , so   T   lies “ahead” of   S   on the curve. If   k   is suf fi ciently small (we can take   k   to be as small as we like since   k   <   0 ) then   3 3 <  S T   approximates the curve from   S   to   T   and hence points approximately in the direction of the curve as   w   increases. Since   k   is positive,  1  k  3 3 <  S T   =   r ( w   +   k )   3   r ( w )  k   points in the same direction. If   k ?   0 , then   w A w   +   k   so   T   lies “behind”   S   on the curve. For   k  suf fi ciently small,   3 3 <  S T   approximates the curve but points in the direction of decreasing   w . However,   k   is negative, so  1  k  3 3 <  S T   =   r ( w   +   k )   3   r ( w )  k   points in the opposite direction, that is, in the direction of increasing   w . In both cases, the difference quotient   r ( w   +   k )   3   r ( w )  k   points in the direction of increasing   w . The tangent vector   r 0 ( w )   is the limit of this difference quotient, so it must also point in the direction of increasing   w .  13.3   Arc Length and Curvature 1.   r ( w ) =   h w>   3 cos   w>   3 sin   w i   i   r 0 ( w ) =   h 1 >   3 3 sin   w>   3 cos   w i   i  | r 0 ( w ) |   =   s 1 2   + ( 3 3 sin   w ) 2   + (3 cos   w ) 2   =   s 1 + 9(sin 2   w   + cos 2   w ) =   I 10 .

To   fi nd the maximum curvature, we   fi rst   fi nd the critical numbers of    ( { ) :   0 ( { ) =   h { (1 +   h 2 { ) 3 3 @ 2   +   h {  3   3 2   (1 +   h 2 { ) 3 5 @ 2 (2 h 2 { ) =   h {   1 +   h 2 {   3   3 h 2 {  (1 +   h 2 { ) 5 @ 2   =   h {   1   3   2 h 2 {  (1 +   h 2 { ) 5 @ 2   .   0 ( { ) = 0   when   1   3   2 h 2 {   = 0 , so   h 2 {   =   1 2   or   {   =   3   1 2   ln 2 . And since   1   3   2 h 2 {   A   0   for   { ?   3   1 2   ln 2   and   1   3   2 h 2 {   ?   0  for   { A   3   1 2   ln 2 , the maximum curvature is attained at the point    3   1 2   ln 2 > h ( 3   ln 2) @ 2    =    3   1 2   ln 2 >   1 I 2    . Since   lim  { <"   h { (1 +   h 2 { ) 3 3 @ 2   = 0 >  ( { )   approaches   0   as   {   < " .  32.   We can take the parabola as having its vertex at the origin and opening upward, so the equation is   i   ( { ) =   d{ 2 > d A   0 . Then by Equation 11,    ( { ) =   | i   00 ( { ) |  [1 + ( i   0 ( { )) 2 ] 3 @ 2   =   | 2 d |  [1 + (2 d{ ) 2 ] 3 @ 2   =   2 d  (1 + 4 d 2 { 2 ) 3 @ 2   , thus    (0) = 2 d . We want    (0) = 4 , so  d   = 2   and the equation is   |   = 2 { 2 .  33.   (a)   F   appears to be changing direction more quickly at   S   than   T , so we would expect the curvature to be greater at   S   . (b) First we sketch approximate osculating circles at   S   and   T . Using the axes scale as a guide, we measure the radius of the osculating circle at   S   to be approximately   0 = 8   units, thus      =  1     i     =  1     E   1 0 = 8   E   1 = 3 . Similarly, we estimate the radius of the osculating circle at   T   to be   1 = 4   units, so      =  1     E   1 1 = 4   E   0 = 7 .  34.   |   =   { 4   3   2 { 2   i   | 0   = 4 { 3   3   4 { ,   | 00   = 12 { 2   3   4 , and   ( { ) =   | | 00 |   1 + ( | 0 ) 2  3 @ 2   =    12 { 2   3   4    1 + (4 { 3   3   4 { ) 2  3 @ 2   . The graph of the curvature here is what we would expect. The graph of   |   =   { 4   3   2 { 2  appears to be bending most sharply at the origin and near   {   =   ± 1 .  35.   |   =   { 3 2   i   | 0   =   3 2 { 3 3 ,   | 00   = 6 { 3 4 , and   ( { ) =   | | 00 |   1 + ( | 0 ) 2  3 @ 2   =    6 { 3 4    1 + ( 3 2 { 3 3 ) 2  3 @ 2   =   6  { 4   (1 + 4 { 3 6 ) 3 @ 2   . The appearance of the two humps in this graph is perhaps a little surprising, but it is explained by the fact that   |   =   { 3 2   increases asymptotically at the origin from both directions, and so its graph has very little bend there.

(To compute cross products in Maple, use the  VectorCalculus   or   LinearAlgebra   package and the   CrossProduct(a,b)   command. Here loading the   RealDomain   package will give simpler results. In Mathematica, use   Cross[a,b] .) Then    ( w ) =   | r 0 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w ) | | r 0 ( w ) | 3   =  I 3   3   4 cos   w   + cos 2 w  8 (1   3   cos   w ) 3 @ 2   or   1 4 I 2   3   2 cos   w   or   1 8   | sin( w@ 2) |   . We plot the space curve and its curvature function for   0   $   w   $   8    below. The asymptotes in the graph of    ( w )   correspond to the sharp cusps we see in the graph of   r ( w ) . The space curve bends most sharply as it approaches these cusps (mostly in the   { -direction) and bends most gradually between these, near its intersections with the   {| -plane, where   w   =      + 2 q   ( q   an integer). (The bending we see in the   } -direction on the curve near these points is deceiving; most of the curvature occurs in the   { -direction.) The curvature graph has local minima at these values of   w .  37.   r ( w ) =   wh w > h 3 w >   I 2 w    i   r 0 ( w ) =   ( w   + 1) h w >   3 h 3 w >   I 2  ,   r 00 ( w ) =   ( w   + 2) h w > h 3 w >   0  .

We plot the space curve and its curvature function for   3 5   $   w   $   5   below. From the graph of    ( w )   we see that curvature is maximized for   w   = 0 , so the curve bends most sharply at the point   (0 >   1 >   0) . The curve bends more gradually as we move away from this point, becoming almost linear. This is re fl ected in the curvature graph, where    ( w )   becomes nearly   0   as   | w |   increases.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Notice that the curve   d   is highest for the same   { -values at which curve   e   is turning more sharply, and   d   is   0   or near   0   where   e   is nearly straight. So,   d   must be the graph of   |   =    ( { ) , and   e   is the graph of   |   =   i   ( { ) .  39.   Notice that the curve   e   has two in fl ection points at which the graph appears almost straight. We would expect the curvature to be   0   or nearly   0   at these values, but the curve   d   isn’t near   0   there. Thus,   d   must be the graph of   |   =   i   ( { )   rather than the graph of curvature, and   e   is the graph of   |   =    ( { ) .  40.   (a) The complete curve is given by   0   $   w   $   2  . Curvature appears to have a local (or absolute) maximum at 6 points. (Look at points where the curve appears to turn more sharply.) (b) Using a CAS, we   fi nd (after simplifying)   ( w ) =   3   I 2   s (5 sin   w   + sin 5 w ) 2  (9 cos 6 w   + 2 cos 4 w   + 11) 3 @ 2   . (To compute cross products in Maple, use the   VectorCalculus   or  LinearAlgebra   package and the  CrossProduct(a,b)   command; in Mathematica, use  Cross[a,b] .) The graph shows 6 local (or absolute) maximum points for   0   $   w   $   2  , as observed in part (a).  41.   Using a CAS, we   fi nd (after simplifying)   ( w ) =  6   I 4 cos 2   w   3   12 cos   w   + 13 (17   3   12 cos   w ) 3 @ 2   . (To compute cross products in Maple, use the   VectorCalculus   or  LinearAlgebra   package and the   CrossProduct(a,b)  command; in Mathematica, use   Cross[a,b] .)

The ellipse is given by the parametric equations   {   = 2 cos   w ,   |   = 3 sin   w , so using the result from Exercise 42,   ( w ) =   |    { ¨ |   3   ¨ {    | |  [    { 2   +    | 2 ] 3 @ 2   =   | ( 3 2 sin   w )( 3 3 sin   w )   3   (3 cos   w )( 3 2 cos   w ) |  (4 sin 2   w   + 9 cos 2   w ) 3 @ 2   =   6 (4 sin 2   w   + 9 cos 2   w ) 3 @ 2   . At   (2 >   0) ,   w   = 0 . Now    (0) =   6 27   =   2 9   , so the radius of the osculating circle is  1 @ (0) =   9 2   and its center is    3   5 2   >   0  . Its equation is therefore    {   +   5 2   2   +   | 2   =   81 4   . At   (0 >   3) ,   w   =     2   , and         2     =   6 8   =   3 4   . So the radius of the osculating circle is   4 3   and its center is    0 >   5 3   . Hence its equation is   { 2   +    |   3   5 3   2   =   16 9   .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

So the curvature at   (0 >   0)   is    (0) = 1   and the osculating circle has radius   1   and center   (0 >   1) , and hence equation   { 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   = 1 . The curvature at    1 >   1 2    is    (1) =   1 (1 + 1 2 ) 3 @ 2   =   1 2   I 2   . The tangent line to the parabola at    1 >   1 2    has slope   1 , so the normal line has slope   3 1 . Thus the center of the osculating circle lies in the direction of the unit vector  G  3   1 I 2   >   1 I 2  H  . The circle has radius   2   I 2 , so its center has position vector  1 >   1 2     + 2   I 2  G  3   1 I 2   >   1 I 2  H  =   3 1 >   5 2   . So the equation of the circle is   ( {   + 1) 2   +    |   3   5 2   2   = 8 .  53.   The tangent vector is normal to the normal plane, and the vector   h 6 >   6 >   3 8 i   is normal to the given plane. But   T ( w )   k   r 0 ( w )   and   h 6 >   6 >   3 8 i k h 3 >   3 >   3 4 i , so we need to   fi nd   w   such that   r 0 ( w )   k h 3 >   3 >   3 4 i .  r ( w ) =   w 3 >   3 w> w 4    i   r 0 ( w ) =   3 w 2 >   3 >   4 w 3    k h 3 >   3 >   3 4 i   when   w   =   3 1 . So the planes are parallel at the point   ( 3 1 >   3 3 >   1) .  54.   To   fi nd the osculating plane, we   fi rst calculate the unit tangent and normal vectors. In Maple, we use the   VectorCalculus   package and set   r:=   ? tˆ3,3*t,tˆ4 A ; . After differentiating, the  Normalize   command converts the tangent vector to the unit tangent vector:   T:=Normalize(diff(r,t)); . After simplifying, we   fi nd that   T ( w ) =   3 w 2 >   3 >   4 w 3   I 16 w 6   + 9 w 4   + 9   . We use a similar procedure to compute the unit normal vector,  N:=Normalize(diff(T,t)); . After simplifying, we have   N ( w ) =   3 w (8 w 6   3   9) >   3 3 w 3 (3 + 8 w 2 ) >   6 w 2 ( w 4   + 3)  s w 2 (4 w 6   + 36 w 2   + 9)(16 w 6   + 9 w 4   + 9)   . Then we use the command   B:=CrossProduct(T,N); . After simpli fi cation, we   fi nd that   B ( w ) =   6 w 2 >   3 2 w 4 >   3 3 w  s w 2 (4 w 6   + 36 w 2   + 9)   . In Mathematica, we de fi ne the vector function   r= { tˆ3,3*t,tˆ4 } and use the command   Dt   to differentiate. We   fi nd  T ( w )   by dividing the result by its magnitude, computed using the   Norm   command. (You may wish to include the option  Element[t,Reals]   to obtain simpler expressions.)   N ( w )   is found similarly, and we use   Cross[T,N]   to   fi nd   B ( w ) . Now   B ( w )   is parallel to   6 w 2 >   3 2 w 4 >   3 3 w  , so if   B ( w )   is parallel to   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   for some   w   6   = 0   [since   B (0) =   0 ], then  6 w 2 >   3 2 w 4 >   3 3 w    =   n   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   for some value of   n . But then   6 w 2   =   3 2 w 4   =   3 3 w   which has no solution for   w   6   = 0 . So there is no such osculating plane.  55.   First we parametrize the curve of intersection. We can choose   |   =   w ; then   {   =   | 2   =   w 2   and   }   =   { 2   =   w 4 , and the curve is given by   r ( w ) =   w 2 > w> w 4  .   r 0 ( w ) =   2 w>   1 >   4 w 3    and the point   (1 >   1 >   1)   corresponds to   w   = 1 , so   r 0 (1) =   h 2 >   1 >   4 i   is a normal vector for the normal plane. Thus an equation of the normal plane is  2( {   3   1) + 1( |   3   1) + 4( }   3   1) = 0   or   2 {   +   |   + 4 }   = 7 .   T ( w ) =   r 0 ( w )  | r 0 ( w ) |   =   1  I 4 w 2   + 1 + 16 w 6   2 w>   1 >   4 w 3    and  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Because the osculating plane at every point on the curve is the same, we can conclude that the curve itself lies in that same plane.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  352   ¤   CHAPTER 13   VECTOR FUNCTIONS  16 w   3   64 = 0   or   w   = 4 . Since   g gw   | v ( w ) |   ?   0   for   w ?   4   and   g gw   | v ( w ) |   A   0   for   w A   4 , the minimum speed of   I 153   is attained at   w   = 4   units of time.  20.   Since   r ( w ) =   w 3   i   +   w 2   j   +   w 3   k ,   a ( w ) =   r 00 ( w ) = 6 w   i   + 2   j   + 6 w   k . By Newton’s Second Law,  F ( w ) =   p   a ( w ) = 6 pw   i   + 2 p   j   + 6 pw   k   is the required force.  21.   | F ( w ) |   = 20   N in the direction of the positive   } -axis, so   F ( w ) = 20   k . Also   p   = 4   kg,   r (0) =   0   and   v (0) =   i   3   j . Since   20 k   =   F ( w ) = 4   a ( w ) ,   a ( w ) = 5   k . Then   v ( w ) = 5 w   k   +   c 1   where   c 1   =   i   3   j   so   v ( w ) =   i   3   j   + 5 w   k   and the speed is   | v ( w ) |   =   I 1 + 1 + 25 w 2   =   I 25 w 2   + 2 . Also   r ( w ) =   w   i   3   w   j   +   5 2   w 2   k   +   c 2   and   0   =   r (0) , so   c 2   =   0  and   r ( w ) =   w   i   3   w   j   +   5 2   w 2   k .  22.   The argument here is the same as that in Example 13.2.4 with   r ( w )   replaced by   v ( w )   and   r 0 ( w )   replaced by   a ( w ) .  23.   | v (0) |   = 200   m @ s and, since the angle of elevation is   60  , a unit vector in the direction of the velocity is  (cos 60  ) i   + (sin 60  ) j   =   1 2   i   +   I 3 2   j . Thus   v (0) = 200     1 2   i   +   I 3 2   j    = 100   i   + 100   I 3   j   and if we set up the axes so that the projectile starts at the origin, then   r (0) =   0 . Ignoring air resistance, the only force is that due to gravity, so  F ( w ) =   p a ( w ) =   3 pj   j   where   j   E   9 = 8   m @ s 2 . Thus   a ( w ) =   3 9 = 8   j   and, integrating, we have   v ( w ) =   3 9 = 8 w   j   +   C . But  100   i   + 100   I 3   j   =   v (0) =   C , so   v ( w ) = 100   i   +    100   I 3   3   9 = 8 w    j   and then (integrating again)  r ( w ) = 100   w   i   +    100   I 3   w   3   4 = 9 w 2    j   +   D   where   0   =   r (0) =   D . Thus the position function of the projectile is  r ( w ) = 100   w   i   +    100   I 3   w   3   4 = 9 w 2    j . (a) Parametric equations for the projectile are   { ( w ) = 100 w ,   | ( w ) = 100   I 3   w   3   4 = 9 w 2 . The projectile reaches the ground when  | ( w ) = 0   (and   w A   0 )   i   100   I 3   w   3   4 = 9 w 2   =   w  100   I 3   3   4 = 9 w    = 0   i   w   =   100 I 3 4 = 9   E   35 = 3   s. So the range is  {     100 I 3 4 = 9    = 100     100 I 3 4 = 9    E   3535   m. (b) The maximum height is reached when   | ( w )   has a critical number (or equivalently, when the vertical component of velocity is   0 ):   | 0 ( w ) = 0   i   100   I 3   3   9 = 8 w   = 0   i   w   =   100 I 3 9 = 8   E   17 = 7   s. Thus the maximum height is  |     100 I 3 9 = 8    = 100   I 3     100 I 3 9 = 8    3   4 = 9     100 I 3 9 = 8   2  E   1531   m. (c) From part (a), impact occurs at   w   =   100 I 3 4 = 9   s. Thus, the velocity at impact is  v     100 I 3 4 = 9    = 100   i   +  k  100   I 3   3   9 = 8     100 I 3 4 = 9  l  j   = 100   i   3   100   I 3   j   and the speed is     v     100 I 3 4 = 9       =   I 10 , 000 + 30 , 000 = 200   m @ s.  24.   As in Exercise 23,   v ( w ) = 100   i   +    100   I 3   3   9 = 8 w    j   and   r ( w ) = 100   w   i   +    100   I 3   w   3   4 = 9 w 2    j   +   D . But   r (0) = 100   j , so   D   = 100   j   and   r ( w ) = 100   w   i   +    100 + 100   I 3   w   3   4 = 9 w 2    j .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

From the quadratic formula we have  w   =  100   I 3   ±  t  ( 3 100   I 3 ) 2   3   4(4 = 9)( 3 100) 2(4 = 9)   =  100   I 3   ±   I 31 , 960 9 = 8   . Taking the positive   w -value gives  w   =   100 I 3 +   I 31 , 960 9 = 8   E   35 = 9   s. Thus the range is   {   = 100   ·   100 I 3 +   I 31 , 960 9 = 8   E   3592   m.

Alternate solution:   Because the projectile is   fi red in the same direction and with the same velocity as in Exercise 23, but from a point   100   m higher, the maximum height reached is   100   m higher than that found in Exercise 23, that is,  1531   m   + 100   m   = 1631   m. (c) From part (a), impact occurs at   w   =   100 I 3 +   I 31 , 960 9 = 8   s. Thus the velocity at impact is  v     100 I 3 +   I 31 , 960 9 = 8    = 100   i   +  k  100   I 3   3   9 = 8     100 I 3 +   I 31 , 960 9 = 8  l  j   = 100   i   3  I 31 , 960   j   and the speed is  | v |   =   I 10 , 000 + 31 , 960 =   I 41 , 960   E   205   m @ s.  25.

As in Example 5,   r ( w ) = ( y 0   cos 30  ) w   i   +    ( y 0   sin 30  ) w   3   1 2   jw 2    j   =   1 2   y 0  I 3   w   i   + ( y 0   w   3   jw 2 )   j    and then  v ( w ) =   r 0 ( w ) =   1 2   y 0  I 3   i   + ( y 0   3   2 jw )   j  . The shell reaches its maximum height when the vertical component of velocity is zero, so   1 2   ( y 0   3   2 jw ) = 0   i   w   =   y 0  2 j   .

Let      be the angle of elevation. Then   y 0   = 150   m @ s and from Example 5, the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile is  g   =   y 2 0   sin 2  j   . Thus   150 2   sin 2  j   = 800   i   sin 2    =  800 j  150 2   E   0 = 3484   i   2    E   20 = 4    or   180   3   20 = 4 = 159 = 6  . Two angles of elevation then are      E   10 = 2    and      E   79 = 8  .  28.   Here   y 0   = 115   ft @ s, the angle of elevation is      = 50  , and if we place the origin at home plate, then   r (0) = 3   j . As in Example 5, we have   r   ( w ) =   3   1 2   jw 2   j   +   w   v 0   +   D   where   D   =   r (0) = 3   j   and   v 0   =   y 0   cos      i   +   y 0   sin      j , so   r ( w ) = ( y 0   cos    ) w   i   +    ( y 0   sin    ) w   3   1 2   jw 2   + 3    j .

Since the fence is   10   ft high, the ball clears the fence.  29.   Place the catapult at the origin and assume the catapult is 100 meters from the city, so the city lies between   (100 >   0)  and   (600 >   0) . The initial speed is   y 0   = 80   m @ s and let      be the angle the catapult is set at. As in Example 5, the trajectory of the catapulted rock is given by   r   ( w ) = (80 cos    ) w   i   +    (80 sin    ) w   3   4 = 9 w 2    j . The top of the near city wall is at   (100 >   15) , which the rock will hit when   (80 cos    )   w   = 100   i   w   =   5 4 cos      and   (80 sin    ) w   3   4 = 9 w 2   = 15   i  80 sin      ·   5 4 cos      3   4 = 9     5 4 cos      2  = 15   i   100 tan      3   7 = 65625 sec 2      = 15 . Replacing   sec 2      with   tan 2      + 1   gives  7 = 65625 tan 2      3   100 tan      + 22 = 65625 = 0 . Using the quadratic formula, we have   tan      E   0 = 230635 ,   12 = 8306   i     E   13 = 0  ,   85 = 5  . So for   13 = 0    ?  ?   85 = 5  , the rock will land beyond the near city wall. The base of the far wall is located at   (600 >   0)   which the rock hits if   (80 cos    ) w   = 600   i   w   =   15 2 cos      and   (80 sin    ) w   3   4 = 9 w 2   = 0   i  80 sin      ·   15 2 cos      3   4 = 9     15 2 cos      2  = 0   i   600 tan      3   275 = 625 sec 2      = 0   i  275 = 625 tan 2      3   600 tan      + 275 = 625 = 0 .

Thus the rock lands beyond the enclosed city ground for   33 = 4    ?  ?   56 = 6  , and the angles that allow the rock to land on city ground are   13 = 0    ?  ?   33 = 4  ,   56 = 6    ?  ?   85 = 5  . If you consider that the rock can hit the far wall and bounce back into the city, we calculate the angles that cause the rock to hit the top of the wall at   (600 >   15) :   (80 cos    ) w   = 600   i   w   =   15 2 cos      and  (80 sin    ) w   3   4 = 9 w 2   = 15   i   600 tan      3   275 = 625 sec 2      = 15   i   275 = 625 tan 2      3   600 tan      + 290 = 625 = 0 .

Place the ball at the origin and consider   j   to be pointing in the northward direction with   i   pointing east and   k   pointing upward. Force   =   mass   ×   acceleration   i   acceleration = force @ mass, so the wind applies a constant acceleration of  4 N @ 0 = 8 kg = 5   m @ s 2   in the easterly direction. Combined with the acceleration due to gravity, the acceleration acting on the ball is   a ( w ) = 5   i   3   9 = 8   k . Then   v ( w ) =   U   a ( w )   gw   = 5 w   i   3   9 = 8 w   k   +   C   where   C   is a constant vector.

If we place the origin at   D   (and consider   j  to coincide with the northern direction) then   r (0) =   0   i   C   =   0   and we have   r ( w ) = 5 w   i   +      3 4   w 2   3   1 16   w 3    j .

If   r 0 ( w ) =   c   ×   r ( w )   then   r 0 ( w )   is perpendicular to both   c   and   r ( w ) . Remember that   r 0 ( w )   points in the direction of motion, so if  r 0 ( w )   is always perpendicular to   c , the path of the particle must lie in a plane perpendicular to   c . But   r 0 ( w )   is also perpendicular to the position vector   r ( w )   which con fi nes the path to a sphere centered at the origin. Considering both restrictions, the path must be contained in a circle that lies in a plane perpendicular to   c , and the circle is centered on a line through the origin in the direction of   c .  36.   (a) From Equation 7 we have   a   =   y 0 T   +   y 2 N . If a particle moves along a straight line, then      = 0   [see Section 13.3], so the acceleration vector becomes   a   =   y 0 T . Because the acceleration vector is a scalar multiple of the unit tangent vector, it is parallel to the tangent vector.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The tangential component of   a   is the length of the projection of   a   onto   T , so we sketch the scalar projection of   a   in the tangential direction to the curve and estimate its length to be   4 = 5   (using the fact that   a   has length   10   as a guide). Similarly, the normal component of  a   is the length of the projection of   a   onto   N , so we sketch the scalar projection of   a   in the normal direction to the curve and estimate its length to be   9 = 0 . Thus   d W   E   4 = 5   cm @ s 2   and  d Q   E   9 = 0   cm @ s 2 .  44.

(a) Since   gD@gw   =   1 2   k , a constant,   D ( w ) =   1 2   kw   +   f 1 . But   D (0) = 0 , so   D ( w ) =   1 2   kw .

The binormal vector, by the de fi nition given in Section 13.3, is   B ( w ) =   T ( w )   ×   N ( w ) =   3   [ N ( w )   ×   T ( w )] .  9.   True. At an in fl ection point where   i   is twice continuously differentiable we must have   i   00 ( { ) = 0 , and by Equation 13.3.11, the curvature is   0   there.  10.   True. From Equation 13.3.9 ,    ( w ) = 0   C   | T 0 ( w ) |   = 0   C   T 0 ( w ) =   0   for all   w . But then   T ( w ) =   C , a constant vector, which is true only for a straight line.  11.   False. If   r ( w )   is the position of a moving particle at time   w   and   | r ( w ) |   = 1   then the particle lies on the unit circle or the unit sphere, but this does not mean that the speed   | r 0 ( w ) |   must be constant. As a counterexample, let   r ( w ) =   w>   I 1   3   w 2  , then  r 0 ( w ) =   1 >   3 w@ I 1   3   w 2    and   | r ( w ) |   =   I w 2   + 1   3   w 2   = 1   but   | r 0 ( w ) |   =   s 1 +   w 2 @ (1   3   w 2 ) = 1 @ I 1   3   w 2   which is not constant.  12.   True. See Example 4 in Section 13.2 .  13.   True. See the discussion preceding Example 7 in Section 13.3.  14.   False. For example,   r 1 ( w ) =   h w> w i   and   r 2 ( w ) =   h 2 w>   2 w i   both represent the same plane curve (the line   |   =   { ), but the tangent vector   r 0  1 ( w ) =   h 1 >   1 i   for all   w , while   r 0  2 ( w ) =   h 2 >   2 i . In fact, different parametrizations give parallel tangent vectors at a point, but their magnitudes may differ.  1.   (a) The corresponding parametric equations for the curve are   {   =   w ,  |   = cos   w ,   }   = sin   w . Since   | 2   +   } 2   = 1 , the curve is contained in a circular cylinder with axis the   { -axis. Since   {   =   w , the curve is a helix. (b)   r ( w ) =   w   i   + cos   w   j   + sin   w   k   i  r 0 ( w ) =   i   3      sin   w   j   +      cos   w   k   i  r 00 ( w ) =   3  2   cos   w   j   3    2   sin   w   k  2.   (a) The expressions   I 2   3   w ,   ( h w   3   1) @w , and   ln( w   + 1)   are all de fi ned when   2   3   w   D   0   i   w   $   2 ,   w   6   = 0 , and   w   + 1   A   0   i   w A   3 1 . Thus the domain of   r   is   ( 3 1 >   0)      (0 >   2] .

The projection of the curve   F   of intersection onto the   {| -plane is the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 16 > }   = 0 . So we can write  {   = 4 cos   w ,   |   = 4 sin   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  . From the equation of the plane, we have   }   = 5   3   {   = 5   3   4 cos   w , so parametric equations for   F   are   {   = 4 cos   w ,   |   = 4 sin   w ,   }   = 5   3   4 cos   w ,   0   $   w   $   2  , and the corresponding vector function is  r ( w ) = 4 cos   w   i   + 4 sin   w   j   + (5   3   4 cos   w )   k ,   0   $   w   $   2  .  4.   The curve is given by   r ( w ) =   h 2 sin   w>   2 sin 2 w>   2 sin 3 w i , so  r 0 ( w ) =   h 2 cos   w>   4 cos 2 w>   6 cos 3 w i . The point    1 >   I 3 >   2    corresponds to   w   =     6  (or     6   + 2 n ,   n   an integer), so the tangent vector there is   r 0 (     6   ) =   I 3 >   2 >   0  . Then the tangent line has direction vector   I 3 >   2 >   0    and includes the point   1 >   I 3 >   2  , so parametric equations are   {   = 1 +   I 3   w ,   |   =   I 3 + 2 w ,   }   = 2 .  5.

(a)   F   intersects the   {} -plane where   |   = 0   i   2 w   3   1 = 0   i   w   =   1 2   , so the point is    2   3      1 2   3 >   0 >   ln   1 2    =      15 8   >   0 >   3   ln 2  . (b) The curve is given by   r ( w ) =   2   3   w 3 >   2 w   3   1 >   ln   w  , so   r 0 ( w ) =   3 3 w 2 >   2 >   1 @w  . The point   (1 >   1 >   0)   corresponds to   w   = 1 , so the tangent vector there is   r 0 (1) =   h 3 3 >   2 >   1 i . Then the tangent line has direction vector   h 3 3 >   2 >   1 i   and includes the point  (1 >   1 >   0) , so parametric equations are   {   = 1   3   3 w ,   |   = 1 + 2 w ,   }   =   w .

The angle of intersection of the two curves,    , is the angle between their respective tangents at the point of intersection. For both curves the point   (1 >   0 >   0)   occurs when   w   = 0 .  r 0  1 ( w ) =   3   sin   w   i   + cos   w   j   +   k   i   r 0  1 (0) =   j   +   k   and   r 0  2 ( w ) =   i   + 2 w   j   + 3 w 2   k   i   r 0  2 (0) =   i .  r 0  1 (0)   ·   r 0  2 (0) = ( j   +   k )   ·   i   = 0 .   Therefore, the curves intersect in a right angle, that is,      =     2   .  10.   The parametric value corresponding to the point   (1 >   0 >   1)   is   w   = 0 .  r 0 ( w ) =   h w   i   +   h w (cos   w   + sin   w )   j   +   h w (cos   w   3   sin   w )   k   i   | r 0 ( w ) |   =   h w s 1 + (cos   w   + sin   w ) 2   + (cos   w   3   sin   w ) 2   =   I 3   h w  and   v ( w ) =   U   w  0   h x I 3   gx   =   I 3( h w   3   1)   i   w   = ln    1 +   1 I 3   v    .

Then a unit vector in the direction of   v (0)   is  1 I 2   ( i   +   j )   i   v (0) =   43 I 2   ( i   +   j ) .

Since   r 0 ( w ) =   v ( w )   we integrate again, so  r ( w ) =   43 I 2   w   i   +     43 I 2   w   3   1 2   jw 2    j   +   D .

(a) At   2   seconds, the shot is at   r (2) =   43 I 2   (2)   i   +     43 I 2   (2)   3   1 2   j (2) 2   + 7    j   E   60 = 8   i   + 3 = 8   j , so the shot is about   3 = 8   ft above the ground, at a horizontal distance of   60 = 8   ft from the athlete. (b) The shot reaches its maximum height when the vertical component of velocity is   0 :   43 I 2   3   jw   = 0   i  w   =   43  I 2   j   E   0 = 95   s. Then   r (0 = 95)   E   28 = 9   i   + 21 = 4   j , so the maximum height is approximately   21 = 4   ft. (c) The shot hits the ground when the vertical component of   r ( w )   is   0 , so   43 I 2   w   3   1 2   jw 2   + 7 = 0   i 3 16 w 2   +   43 I 2   w   + 7 = 0   i   w   E   2 = 11   s.   r (2 = 11)   E   64 = 2   i   3   0 = 08   j , thus the shot lands approximately   64 = 2   ft from the athlete.  20.   r 0 ( w ) =   i   + 2   j   + 2 w   k ,   r 00 ( w ) = 2   k ,   | r 0 ( w ) |   =   I 1 + 4 + 4 w 2   =   I 4 w 2   + 5 . Then   d W   =   r 0 ( w )   ·   r 00 ( w )  | r 0 ( w ) |   =   4 w  I 4 w 2   + 5   and   d Q   =   | r 0 ( w )   ×   r 00 ( w ) | | r 0 ( w ) |   =   | 4   i   3   2   j |  I 4 w 2   + 5  =   2   I 5  I 4 w 2   + 5   .  21.   (a) Instead of proceeding directly, we use Formula 3 of Theorem 13.2.3:   r ( w ) =   w   R ( w )   i  v   =   r 0 ( w ) =   R ( w ) +   w   R 0 ( w ) = cos   $w   i   + sin   $w   j   +   w   v g . (b) Using the same method as in part (a) and starting with   v   =   R ( w ) +   w   R 0 ( w ) , we have  a   =   v 0   =   R 0 ( w ) +   R 0 ( w ) +   w   R 00 ( w ) = 2   R 0 ( w ) +   w   R 00 ( w ) = 2   v g   +   w   a g . (c) Here we have   r ( w ) =   h 3 w   cos   $w   i   +   h 3 w   sin   $w   j   =   h 3 w   R ( w ) . So, as in parts (a) and (b),  v   =   r 0 ( w ) =   h 3 w   R 0 ( w )   3   h 3 w   R ( w ) =   h 3 w [ R 0 ( w )   3   R ( w )]   i  a   =   v 0   =   h 3 w [ R 00 ( w )   3   R 0 ( w )]   3   h 3 w [ R 0 ( w )   3   R ( w )] =   h 3 w [ R 00 ( w )   3   2   R 0 ( w ) +   R ( w )] =   h 3 w   a g   3   2 h 3 w   v g   +   h 3 w   R  Thus, the Coriolis acceleration (the sum of the “extra” terms not involving   a g ) is   3 2 h 3 w   v g   +   h 3 w   R .  22.

But  lim  { < 0 +   I   00 ( { ) =   3 1   6   = 0 =   lim  { < 0    I   00 ( { ) , so   I   00   is not continuous at   {   = 0 . (The same is true at   {   =   1 I 2   .) So   I   does not have continuous curvature. (b) Set   S   ( { ) =   d{ 5   +   e{ 4   +   f{ 3   +   g{ 2   +   h{   +   i   . The continuity conditions on   S   are   S   (0) = 0 ,   S   (1) = 1 ,   S   0 (0) = 0   and  S   0 (1) = 1 . Also the curvature must be continuous. For   {   $   0   and   {   D   1 ,    ( { ) = 0 ; elsewhere   ( { ) =   | S   00 ( { ) |  (1 + [ S   0 ( { )] 2 ) 3 @ 2   , so we need   S   00 (0) = 0   and   S   00 (1) = 0 . The conditions   S   (0) =   S   0 (0) =   S   00 (0) = 0   imply that   g   =   h   =   i   = 0 . The other conditions imply that   d   +   e   +   f   = 1 ,   5 d   + 4 e   + 3 f   = 1 , and  10 d   + 6 e   + 3 f   = 0 . From these, we   fi nd that   d   = 3 ,   e   =   3 8 , and   f   = 6 . Therefore   S   ( { ) = 3 { 5   3   8 { 4   + 6 { 3 . Since there was no solution with  d   = 0 , this could not have been done with a polynomial of degree   4 .  23.   (a)   r ( w ) =   U   cos   $w   i   +   U   sin   $w   j   i   v   =   r 0 ( w ) =   3 $U   sin   $w   i   +   $U   cos   $w   j , so   r   =   U (cos   $w   i   + sin   $w   j )   and  v   =   $U ( 3   sin   $w   i   + cos   $w   j ) .   v   ·   r   =   $U 2 ( 3   cos   $w   sin   $w   + sin   $w   cos   $w ) = 0 , so   v   z   r . Since   r   points along a radius of the circle, and   v   z   r ,   v   is tangent to the circle. Because it is a velocity vector,   v   points in the direction of motion. (b) In (a), we wrote   v   in the form   $U   u , where   u   is the unit vector   3   sin   $w   i   + cos   $w   j . Clearly   | v |   =   $U   | u |   =   $U . At speed   $U , the particle completes one revolution, a distance   2 U , in time   W   =  2 U $U   =  2  $   . (c)   a   =   g v  gw   =   3 $ 2 U   cos   $w   i   3   $ 2 U   sin   $w   j   =   3 $ 2 U (cos   $w   i   + sin   $w   j ) , so   a   =   3 $ 2 r . This shows that   a   is proportional to   r   and points in the opposite direction (toward the origin). Also,   | a |   =   $ 2   | r |   =   $ 2 U . (d) By Newton’s Second Law (see Section 13.4),   F   =   p a , so   | F |   =   p   | a |   =   pU$ 2   =   p   ( $U ) 2  U   =   p   | v | 2  U   .  24.   (a) Dividing the equation   | F |   sin      =   py 2  U  U   by the equation   | F |   cos      =   pj , we obtain   tan      =   y 2  U  Uj   , so   y 2  U   =   Uj   tan    . (b)   U   = 400   ft and      = 12  , so   y U   =   I Uj   tan      E  I 400   ·   32   ·   tan 12    E   52 = 16   ft @ s   E   36   mi @ h. (c) We want to choose a new radius   U 1   for which the new rated speed is   3 2   of the old one:   I U 1 j   tan 12    =   3 2  I Uj   tan 12  . Squaring, we get   U 1 j   tan 12    =   9 4   Uj   tan 12  , so   U 1   =   9 4   U   =   9 4   (400) = 900   ft.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

In that case,   sin      = 1  and the maximum height is   y 2 0  2 j   . (b) Let   U   =   y 2 0   j . We are asked to consider the parabola   { 2   + 2 U|   3   U 2   = 0   which can be rewritten as   |   =   3   1 2 U  { 2   +   U  2   .

This condition is satis fi ed since   ( d> e )   is on or inside the parabola  |   =   3   1 2 U  { 2   +   U  2   . It follows that   ( d> e )   lies in the path of the projectile when   tan      satis fi es ( B ), that is, when  tan      =  2 dU   ±   s 4 d 2 ( U 2   3   d 2   3   2 eU ) 2 d 2   =   U   ±   I U 2   3   2 eU   3   d 2  d   . (c)   If the gun is pointed at a target with height   k   at a distance   G   downrange, then  tan      =   k@G . When the projectile reaches a distance   G   downrange (remember we are assuming that it doesn’t hit the ground   fi rst), we have   G   =   {   = ( y 0   cos    ) w , so   w   =   G y 0   cos      and   |   = ( y 0   sin    ) w   3   1 2   jw 2   =   G   tan      3   jG 2  2 y 2 0   cos 2      .

Thus the projectile hits the target.  2.   (a) As in Problem 1,   r ( w ) = ( y 0   cos    ) w   i   +    ( y 0   sin    ) w   3   1 2   jw 2    j , so   {   = ( y 0   cos    ) w   and   |   = ( y 0   sin    ) w   3   1 2   jw 2 . The difference here is that the projectile travels until it reaches a point where   { A   0   and   |   =   3 (tan    ) { . (Here   0   $      $     2   .) From the parametric equations, we obtain   w   =   { y 0   cos      and   |   =  ( y 0   sin    ) { y 0   cos      3   j{ 2  2 y 2 0   cos 2      = (tan    ) {   3   j{ 2  2 y 2 0   cos 2      . Thus the projectile hits the inclined plane at the point where   (tan    ) {   3   j{ 2  2 y 2 0   cos 2      =   3 (tan    ) { . Since  j{ 2  2 y 2 0   cos 2      = (tan      + tan    ) {   and   { A   0 , we must have   j{  2 y 2 0   cos 2      = tan      + tan    . It follows that  {   =  2 y 2 0   cos 2    j   (tan      + tan    )   and   w   =   { y 0   cos      =  2 y 0   cos    j   (tan      + tan    ) .

(b) The downhill range (that is, the distance to the projectile’s landing point as measured along the inclined plane) is   U (  ) =   {   sec    , where   {   is the coordinate of the landing point calculated in part (a).

(c) The solution is similar to the solutions to parts (a) and (b). This time the projectile travels until it reaches a point where  { A   0   and   |   = (tan    ) { . Since   tan      =   3   tan( 3  ) , we obtain the solution from the previous one by replacing      with   3  . The desired angle is      =   1 2       2   +     . (d) As observed in part (c),   fi ring the projectile up an inclined plane with angle of inclination      involves the same equations as in parts (a) and (b) but with      replaced by   3  . So if   U   is the distance up an inclined plane, we know from part (b) that  U   =  2 y 2 0   cos      sin(    3    )  j   cos 2 ( 3  )   i   y 2 0   =   Uj   cos 2     2 cos      sin(    3    )   .   y 2 0   is minimized (and hence   y 0   is minimized) with respect to      when  0 =   g g   ( y 2 0   ) =   Uj   cos 2     2   ·   3 (cos      cos (    3    )   3   sin      sin (    3    )) [cos      sin(    3    )] 2  =   3 Uj   cos 2     2   ·   cos[    + (    3    )] [cos      sin(    3    )] 2   =   3 Uj   cos 2     2   ·   cos(2    3    ) [cos      sin(    3    )] 2  Since    ?  ?     2   , this implies   cos(2    3    ) = 0   C   2    3      =     2   i      =   1 2       2   +     . Thus the initial speed, and hence the energy required, is minimized for      =   1 2       2   +     .  3.   (a)   a   =   3 j   j   i   v   =   v 0   3   jw   j   = 2   i   3   jw   j   i   s   =   s 0   + 2 w   i   3   1 2   jw 2   j   = 3 = 5   j   + 2 w   i   3   1 2   jw 2   j   i  s   = 2 w   i   +    3 = 5   3   1 2   jw 2    j . Therefore   |   = 0   when   w   =   s 7 @j   seconds. At that instant, the ball is   2   s 7 @j   E   0 = 94   ft to the right of the table top. Its coordinates (relative to an origin on the   fl oor directly under the table’s edge) are   (0 = 94 >   0) . At impact, the velocity is   v   = 2   i   3  I 7 j   j , so the speed is   | v |   =   I 4 + 7 j   E   15   ft @ s. (b) The slope of the curve when   w   =  u   7  j   is   g| g{   =   g|@gw g{@gw   =   3 jw  2   =   3 j   s 7 @j  2   =   3 I 7 j  2   . Thus   cot      =  I 7 j  2  and      E   7 = 6  . (c) From (a),   | v |   =   I 4 + 7 j . So the ball rebounds with speed   0 = 8   I 4 + 7 j   E   12 = 08   ft @ s at angle of inclination  90    3      E   82 = 3886  . By Example 13.4.5, the horizontal distance traveled between bounces is   g   =   y 2 0   sin 2  j   , where  y 0   E   12 = 08   ft @ s and      E   82 = 3886  . Therefore,   g   E   1 = 197   ft. So the ball strikes the   fl oor at about  2   s 7 @j   + 1 = 197   E   2 = 13   ft to the right of the table’s edge.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus the distance traveled by the projectile is maximized for      E   0 = 9855   or   E   56  .  6.   As the cable is wrapped around the spool, think of the top or bottom of the cable forming a helix of radius   U   +   u . Let   k   be the vertical distance between coils. Then, from similar triangles,  2 u  I k 2   3   4 u 2   =  2  ( u   +   U )  k   i   k 2 u 2   =    2 ( u   +   U ) 2 ( k 2   3   4 u 2 )   i  k   =   2 u ( u   +   U )  s  2 ( u   +   U ) 2   3   u 2   . If we parametrize the helix by   { ( w ) = ( U   +   u ) cos   w ,   | ( w ) = ( U   +   u ) sin   w , then we must have   } ( w ) = [ k@ (2  )] w .

We can write the vector equation as   r ( w ) =   a w 2   +   b w   +   c   where   a   =   h d 1 > d 2 > d 3 i ,   b   =   h e 1 > e 2 > e 3 i , and   c   =   h f 1 > f 2 > f 3 i . Then   r 0 ( w ) = 2 w   a   +   b   which says that each tangent vector is the sum of a scalar multiple of   a   and the vector   b . Thus the tangent vectors are all parallel to the plane determined by   a   and   b   so the curve must be parallel to this plane. [Here we assume that   a   and   b   are nonparallel. Otherwise the tangent vectors are all parallel and the curve lies along a single line.] A normal vector for the plane is   a   ×   b   =   h d 2 e 3   3   d 3 e 2 > d 3 e 1   3   d 1 e 3 > d 1 e 2   3   d 2 e 1 i . The point   ( f 1 ,   f 2 ,   f 3 )   lies on the plane (when  w   = 0 ), so an equation of the plane is  ( d 2 e 3   3   d 3 e 2 )( {   3   f 1 ) + ( d 3 e 1   3   d 1 e 3 )( |   3   f 2 ) + ( d 1 e 2   3   d 2 e 1 )( }   3   f 3 ) = 0  or  ( d 2 e 3   3   d 3 e 2 ) {   + ( d 3 e 1   3   d 1 e 3 ) |   + ( d 1 e 2   3   d 2 e 1 ) }   =   d 2 e 3 f 1   3   d 3 e 2 f 1   +   d 3 e 1 f 2   3   d 1 e 3 f 2   +   d 1 e 2 f 3   3   d 2 e 1 f 3  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(a) From Table 1,   i ( 3 15 >   40) =   3 27 , which means that if the temperature is   3 15  C   and the wind speed is   40   km @ h, then the air would feel equivalent to approximately   3 27  C   without wind. (b) The question is asking: when the temperature is   3 20  C , what wind speed gives a wind-chill index of   3 30  C ? From Table 1, the speed is   20   km @ h. (c) The question is asking: when the wind speed is   20   km @ h, what temperature gives a wind-chill index of   3 49  C ? From Table 1, the temperature is   3 35  C . (d) The function   Z   =   i   ( 3 5 > y )   means that we   fi x   W   at   3 5   and allow   y   to vary, resulting in a function of one variable. In other words, the function gives wind-chill index values for different wind speeds when the temperature is   3 5  C . From Table 1 (look at the row corresponding to   W   =   3 5 ), the function decreases and appears to approach a constant value as   y  increases. (e) The function   Z   =   i   ( W>   50)   means that we   fi x   y   at   50   and allow   W   to vary, again giving a function of one variable. In other words, the function gives wind-chill index values for different temperatures when the wind speed is   50   km @ h . From Table 1 (look at the column corresponding to   y   = 50 ), the function increases almost linearly as   W   increases.  2.   (a) From Table 3,   i   (95 >   70) = 124 , which means that when the actual temperature is   95  F   and the relative humidity is   70% , the perceived air temperature is approximately   124  F . (b) Looking at the row corresponding to   W   = 90 , we see that   i (90 > k ) = 100   when   k   = 60 . (c) Looking at the column corresponding to   k   = 50 , we see that   i   ( W>   50) = 88   when   W   = 85 . (d)   L   =   i   (80 > k )   means that   W   is   fi xed at   80   and   k   is allowed to vary, resulting in a function of   k   that gives the humidex values for different relative humidities when the actual temperature is   80  F . Similarly,   L   =   i   (100 > k )   is a function of one variable that gives the humidex values for different relative humidities when the actual temperature is   100  F . Looking at the rows of the table corresponding to   W   = 80   and   W   = 100 >   we see that   i   (80 > k )   increases at a relatively constant rate of approximately   1  F   per   10%   relative humidity, while   i (100 > k )   increases more quickly (at   fi rst with an average rate of change of   5  F   per   10%   relative humidity) and at an increasing rate (approximately   12  F   per   10%   relative humidity for larger values of   k ).  3.   S   (120 >   20) = 1 = 47(120) 0 = 65 (20) 0 = 35   E   94 = 2 , so when the manufacturer invests $20 million in capital and 120,000 hours of labor are completed yearly, the monetary value of the production is about $94.2 million.  4.   If the amounts of labor and capital are both doubled, we replace   O> N   in the function with   2 O>   2 N , giving  S   (2 O>   2 N ) = 1 = 01(2 O ) 0 = 75 (2 N ) 0 = 25   = 1 = 01(2 0 = 75 )(2 0 = 25 ) O 0 = 75 N 0 = 25   = (2 1 )1 = 01 O 0 = 75 N 0 = 25   = 2 S   ( O> N )  Thus, the production is doubled. It is also true for the general case   S   ( O> N ) =   eO  N 1   3    :  S   (2 O>   2 N ) =   e (2 O )  (2 N ) 1 3    =   e (2  )(2 1 3  ) O  N 1 3    = (2  +1 3  ) eO  N 1 3    = 2 S   ( O> N ) .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(a)   i   (160 >   70) = 0 = 1091(160) 0 = 425 (70) 0 = 725   E   20 = 5 , which means that the surface area of a person 70 inches (5 feet 10 inches) tall who weighs 160 pounds is approximately 20.5 square feet. (b) Answers will vary depending on the height and weight of the reader.  6.   We compare the values for the wind-chill index given by Table 1 with those given by the model function: Modeled Wind-Chill Index Values   Z   ( W> y )  The values given by the function appear to be fairly close (within   0 = 5 ) to the values in Table 1.  7.   (a) According to Table 4,   i (40 >   15) = 25 , which means that if a   40 -knot wind has been blowing in the open sea for   15   hours, it will create waves with estimated heights of   25   feet. (b)   k   =   i   (30 > w )   means we   fi x   y   at   30   and allow   w   to vary, resulting in a function of one variable. Thus here,   k   =   i   (30 > w )  gives the wave heights produced by   30 -knot winds blowing for   w   hours. From the table (look at the row corresponding to  y   = 30 ), the function increases but at a declining rate as   w   increases. In fact, the function values appear to be approaching a limiting value of approximately   19 , which suggests that   30 -knot winds cannot produce waves higher than about   19   feet. (c)   k   =   i   ( y>   30)   means we   fi x   w   at   30 , again giving a function of one variable. So,   k   =   i   ( y>   30)   gives the wave heights produced by winds of speed   y   blowing for   30   hours. From the table (look at the column corresponding to   w   = 30 ), the function appears to increase at an increasing rate, with no apparent limiting value. This suggests that faster winds (lasting  30   hours) always create higher waves.  8.   (a) The cost of making   {   small boxes,   |   medium boxes, and   }   large boxes is   F   =   i ( {> |> } ) = 8000 + 2 = 5 {   + 4 |   + 4 = 5 }  dollars. (b)   i   (3000 >   5000 >   4000) = 8000 + 2 = 5(3000) + 4(5000) + 4 = 5(4000) = 53 , 500   which means that it costs $53,500 to make 3000 small boxes, 5000 medium boxes, and 4000 large boxes. (c) Because no partial boxes will be produced, each of   { ,   | , and   }   must be a positive integer or zero.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

All six graphs have different traces in the planes   {   = 0   and   |   = 0 , so we investigate these for each function. (a)   i   ( {> | ) =   | { |   +   | | | . The trace in   {   = 0   is   }   =   | | | , and in   |   = 0   is   }   =   | { | , so it must be graph VI. (b)   i   ( {> | ) =   | {| | . The trace in   {   = 0   is   }   = 0 >   and in   |   = 0   is   }   = 0 , so it must be graph V. (c)   i   ( {> | ) =   1 1 +   { 2   +   | 2   .

In addition, we can see that   i   is close to   0   for large values of   {   and   | , so this is graph I.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Both graph II and graph IV seem plausible; notice the trace in   }   = 0   is   0 = ( { 2   3   | 2 ) 2   i   |   =   ± { , so it must be graph IV. (e)   i   ( {> | ) = ( {   3   | ) 2 .

The trace in   {   = 0   is   }   = sin   | | | , and in   |   = 0   is   }   = sin   | { | . In addition, notice that the oscillating nature of the graph is characteristic of trigonometric functions. So this is graph III.  33.   The point   ( 3 3 >   3)   lies between the level curves with   } -values   50   and   60 . Since the point is a little closer to the level curve with  }   = 60 , we estimate that   i   ( 3 3 >   3)   E   56 . The point   (3 >   3 2)   appears to be just about halfway between the level curves with  } -values   30   and   40 , so we estimate   i   (3 >   3 2)   E   35 . The graph rises as we approach the origin, gradually from above, steeply from below.  34.   (a)   F   (Chicago) lies between level curves with pressures 1012 and 1016 mb, and since   F   appears to be located about one-fourth the distance from the 1012 mb isobar to the 1016 mb isobar, we estimate the pressure at Chicago to be about 1013 mb.   Q   lies very close to a level curve with pressure 1012 mb so we estimate the pressure at Nashville to be approximately 1012 mb.   V   appears to be just about halfway between level curves with pressures 1008 and 1012 mb, so we estimate the pressure at San Francisco to be about 1010 mb.   Y   lies close to a level curve with pressure 1016 mb but we can’t see a level curve to its left so it is more dif fi cult to make an accurate estimate. There are lower pressures to the right of   Y   and   Y   is a short distance to the left of the level curve with pressure 1016 mb, so we might estimate that the pressure at Vancouver is about 1017 mb. (b) Winds are stronger where the isobars are closer together (see Figure 13), and the level curves are closer near   V   than at the other locations, so the winds were strongest at San Francisco.  35.   The point   (160 >   10) , corresponding to day 160 and a depth of 10 m, lies between the isothermals with temperature values of   8   and   12  C . Since the point appears to be located about three-fourths the distance from the   8  C   isothermal to the   12  C  isothermal, we estimate the temperature at that point to be approximately   11  C . The point   (180 >   5)   lies between the   16   and  20  C   isothermals, very close to the   20  C   level curve, so we estimate the temperature there to be about   19 = 5  C .  36.   If we start at the origin and move along the   { -axis, for example, the   } -values of a cone centered at the origin increase at a constant rate, so we would expect its level curves to be equally spaced. A paraboloid with vertex the origin, on the other hand, has   } -values which change slowly near the origin and more quickly as we move farther away. Thus, we would expect its level curves near the origin to be spaced more widely apart than those farther from the origin. Therefore contour map I must correspond to the paraboloid, and contour map II the cone.  37.   Near   D , the level curves are very close together, indicating that the terrain is quite steep. At   E , the level curves are much farther apart, so we would expect the terrain to be much less steep than near   D , perhaps almost   fl at.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The graph exhibits different limiting values as   {   and   |  become large or as   ( {> | )   approaches the origin, depending on the direction being examined. For example, although   i   is unde fi ned at the origin, the function values appear to be   1 2   along the line   |   =   { , regardless of the distance from the origin. Along the line   |   =   3 { , the value is always   3   1 2   . Along the axes,   i ( {> | ) = 0   for all values of   ( {> | )   except the origin.

First, if   f   = 0 , the graph is the cylindrical surface  }   =   h | 2  (whose level curves are parallel lines).

In general, we can’t say anything about   i   (3 >   1) !   lim  ( {>| ) < (3 > 1)   i   ( {> | ) = 6   means that the values of   i   ( {> | )   approach   6   as  ( {> | )   approaches, but is not equal to,   (3 >   1) . If   i   is continuous, we know that   lim  ( {>| ) < ( d>e )   i   ( {> | ) =   i ( d> e ) , so  lim  ( {>| ) < (3 > 1)   i   ( {> | ) =   i   (3 >   1) = 6 .  2.   (a) The outdoor temperature as a function of longitude, latitude, and time is continuous. Small changes in longitude, latitude, or time can produce only small changes in temperature, as the temperature doesn’t jump abruptly from one value to another. (b) Elevation is not necessarily continuous. If we think of a cliff with a sudden drop-off, a very small change in longitude or latitude can produce a comparatively large change in elevation, without all the intermediate values being attained. Elevation   can   jump from one value to another. (c) The cost of a taxi ride is usually discontinuous. The cost normally increases in jumps, so small changes in distance traveled or time can produce a jump in cost. A graph of the function would show breaks in the surface.  3.   We make a table of values of  i   ( {> | ) =   { 2 | 3   +   { 3 | 2   3   5 2   3   {|   for a set of   ( {> | )   points near the origin. As the table shows, the values of   i   ( {> | )   seem to approach   3 2 = 5   as   ( {> | )   approaches the origin from a variety of different directions. This suggests that   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( {> | ) =   3 2 = 5 . Since   i   is a rational function, it is continuous on its domain.   i   is de fi ned at   (0 >   0) , so we can use direct substitution to establish that   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)  i   ( {> | ) =  0 2 0 3   + 0 3 0 2   3   5 2   3   0   ·   0   =   3   5 2   , verifying our guess.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

We make a table of values of  i   ( {> | ) =   2 {| { 2   + 2 | 2   for a set of   ( {> | )  points near the origin. It appears from the table that the values of   i   ( {> | )   are not approaching a single value as   ( {> | )   approaches the origin. For veri fi cation, if we   fi rst approach   (0 >   0)   along the   { -axis, we have   i   ( {>   0) = 0 , so   i   ( {> | )   <   0 . But if we approach   (0 >   0)   along the line   |   =   { ,   i   ( {> { ) =   2 { 2  { 2   + 2 { 2   =  2 3   ( {   6   = 0 ), so   i   ( {> | )   <   2 3   . Since   i   approaches different values along different paths to the origin, this limit does not exist.  5.   i   ( {> | ) = 5 { 3   3   { 2 | 2   is a polynomial, and hence continuous, so   lim  ( {>| ) < (1 > 2)   i   ( {> | ) =   i   (1 >   2) = 5(1) 3   3   (1) 2 (2) 2   = 1 .  6.   3 {|   is a polynomial and therefore continuous. Since   h w   is a continuous function, the composition   h 3 {|   is also continuous. Similarly,   {   +   |   is a polynomial and   cos   w   is a continuous function, so the composition   cos( {   +   | )   is continuous. The product of continuous functions is continuous, so   i   ( {> | ) =   h 3 {|   cos( {   +   | )   is a continuous function and  lim  ( {>| ) < (1 > 3 1)   i   ( {> | ) =   i   (1 >   3 1) =   h 3 (1) ( 3 1)   cos(1 + ( 3 1)) =   h 1   cos 0 =   h .  7.   i   ( {> | ) =   4   3   {| { 2   + 3 | 2   is a rational function and hence continuous on its domain.

For   |   6   = 0 ,   i (0 > | ) =   3 4 | 2 @ 2 | 2   =   3 2 , so   i   ( {> | )   < 3 2 . Since   i   has two different limits along two different lines, the limit does not exist.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The functions   h {   +   h |   and   h {|   3   1   are continuous everywhere, so   K ( {> | ) =   h {   +   h |  h {|   3   1   is continuous except where  h {|   3   1 = 0   i   {|   = 0   i   {   = 0   or   |   = 0 .

Since   { 2   $   2 { 2   +   | 2 , we have     { 2 | 3 @ (2 { 2   +   | 2 )     $     | 3   . We know that     | 3     <   0   as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0) . So, by the Squeeze Theorem,   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( {> | ) =   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)  { 2 | 3  2 { 2   +   | 2   = 0 . But   i   (0 >   0) = 1 , so   i   is discontinuous at   (0 >   0) . Therefore,   i   is continuous on the set   { ( {> | )   |   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) } .  38.   i   ( {> | ) =  ; ? =  {| { 2   +   {|   +   | 2   if   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) 0   if   ( {> | ) = (0 >   0)  The   fi rst piece of   i   is a rational function de fi ned everywhere except at the origin, so   i   is continuous on   R 2   except possibly at the origin.   i ( {>   0) = 0 @{ 2   = 0   for   {   6   = 0 , so   i   ( {> | )   <   0   as  ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along the   { -axis.

Thus   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( {> | )   doesn’t exist, so   i   is not continuous at   (0 >   0)   and the largest set on which   i   is continuous is   { ( {> | )   |   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) } .  39.   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)  { 3   +   | 3  { 2   +   | 2   =   lim  u < 0 +  ( u   cos    ) 3   + ( u   sin    ) 3  u 2   =   lim  u < 0 + ( u   cos 3      +   u   sin 3    ) = 0  40.   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0) ( { 2   +   | 2 ) ln( { 2   +   | 2 ) =   lim  u < 0 +   u 2   ln   u 2   =   lim  u < 0 +  ln   u 2  1 @u 2   =   lim  u < 0 +  (1 @u 2 )(2 u )  3 2 @u 3   [using l’Hospital’s Rule]  =   lim  u < 0 + ( 3 u 2 ) = 0  41.   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)  h 3 { 2 3 | 2  3   1  { 2   +   | 2   =   lim  u < 0 +  h 3 u 2  3   1  u 2   =   lim  u < 0 +  h 3 u 2  ( 3 2 u ) 2 u   [using l’Hospital’s Rule]  =   lim  u < 0 +   3 h 3 u 2  =   3 h 0   =   3 1  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Using l’Hospital’s Rule, we get  lim  u < 0 +  sin( u 2 )  u 2  H  =   lim  u < 0 +  2 u   cos( u 2 ) 2 u   =   lim  u < 0 +   cos( u 2 ) = 1 .  Or:   Use the fact that   lim   < 0  sin       = 1 .  43.   i   ( {> | ) =  ; ? =  sin( {| )  {|   if   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) 1   if   ( {> | ) = (0 >   0)  From the graph, it appears that   i   is continuous everywhere. We know  {|   is continuous on   R 2   and   sin   w   is continuous everywhere, so  sin( {| )   is continuous on   R 2   and   sin( {| )  {|   is continuous on   R 2  except possibly where   {|   = 0 . To show that   i   is continuous at those points, consider any point   ( d> e )   in   R 2   where   de   = 0 . Because   {|   is continuous,   {|   <   de   = 0   as   ( {> | )   <   ( d> e ) . If we let   w   =   {| , then   w   <   0   as   ( {> | )   <   ( d> e )   and  lim  ( {>| ) < ( d>e )  sin( {| )  {|   = lim  w < 0  sin( w )  w   = 1   by Equation 2.4.2 [ET 3.3.2]. Thus   lim  ( {>| ) < ( d>e )   i   ( {> | ) =   i   ( d> e )   and   i   is continuous on   R 2 .  44.   (a)   i   ( {> | ) =  + 0   if   |   $   0   or   |   D   { 4  1   if   0   ? | ? { 4   Consider the path   |   =   p{ d ,   0   ? d ?   4 . [The path does not pass through  (0 >   0)   if   d   $   0   except for the trivial case where   p   = 0 .] If   p{ d   $   0   then   i   ( {> p{ d ) = 0 . If   p{ d   A   0   then  p{ d   =   | p{ d |   =   | p | | { d |   and   p{ d   D   { 4   C   | p | | { d |   D   { 4   C   { 4  | { d |   $   | p |   C   | { | 4 3 d   $   | p |   whenever   { d   is de fi ned. Then   p{ d   D   { 4   C   | { |   $   | p | 1 @ (4 3 d )   so   i   ( {> p{ d ) = 0   for   | { |   $   | p | 1 @ (4 3 d )   and   i   ( {> | )   <   0   as  ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along this path. (b) If we approach   (0 >   0)   along the path   |   =   { 5 ,   { A   0   then we have   i   ( {> { 5 ) = 1   for   0   ? { ?   1   because   0   ? { 5   ? { 4   there. Thus   i ( {> | )   <   1   as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along this path, but in part (a) we found a limit of   0   along other paths, so  lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( {> | )   doesn’t exist and   i   is discontinuous at   (0 >   0) . (c) First we show that   i   is discontinuous at any point   ( d>   0)   on the   { -axis. If we approach   ( d>   0)   along the path   {   =   d ,   | A   0  then   i   ( d> | ) = 1   for   0   ? | ? d 4 , so   i   ( {> | )   <   1   as   ( {> | )   <   ( d>   0)   along this path. If we approach   ( d>   0)   along the path  {   =   d ,   | ?   0   then   i   ( d> | ) = 0   since   | ?   0   and   i   ( {> | )   <   0   as   ( {> | )   <   ( d>   0) . Thus the limit does not exist and   i   is discontinuous on the line   |   = 0 .   i   is also discontinuous on the curve   |   =   { 4 : For any point   ( d> d 4 )   on this curve, approaching the point along the path   {   =   d ,   | A d 4   gives   i   ( d> | ) = 0   since   | A d 4 , so   i   ( {> | )   <   0   as   ( {> | )   <   ( d> d 4 ) . But approaching the point along the path   {   =   d ,   | ? d 4   gives   i   ( d> | ) = 1   for   | A   0 , so   i   ( {> | )   <   1   as   ( {> | )   <   ( d> d 4 )  and the limit does not exist there.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Hence   lim x < a   | x |   =   | a |   and  i   ( x ) =   | x |   is continuous on   R q .  46.   Let    A   0   be given.

Set     =   @   | c | .

So   i   is continuous on   R q .  14.3   Partial Derivatives 1.   (a)   CW @C{   represents the rate of change of   W   when we   fi x   |   and   w   and consider   W   as a function of the single variable   { , which describes how quickly the temperature changes when longitude changes but latitude and time are constant.   CW @C|  represents the rate of change of   W   when we   fi x   {   and   w   and consider   W   as a function of   | , which describes how quickly the temperature changes when latitude changes but longitude and time are constant.   CW @Cw   represents the rate of change of   W  when we   fi x   {   and   |   and consider   W   as a function of   w , which describes how quickly the temperature changes over time for a constant longitude and latitude. (b)   i { (158 >   21 >   9)   represents the rate of change of temperature at longitude   158  W, latitude   21  N at 9:00   AM   when only longitude varies. Since the air is warmer to the west than to the east, increasing longitude results in an increased air temperature, so we would expect   i { (158 >   21 >   9)   to be positive.   i |   (158 >   21 >   9)   represents the rate of change of temperature at the same time and location when only latitude varies. Since the air is warmer to the south and cooler to the north, increasing latitude results in a decreased air temperature, so we would expect   i |   (158 >   21 >   9)   to be negative.   i w (158 >   21 >   9)  represents the rate of change of temperature at the same time and location when only time varies. Since typically air temperature increases from the morning to the afternoon as the sun warms it, we would expect   i w (158 >   21 >   9)   to be positive.  2.   By De fi nition 4,   i W   (92 >   60) = lim  k < 0  i   (92 +   k>   60)   3   i   (92 >   60)  k   , which we can approximate by considering   k   = 2   and  k   =   3 2   and using the values given in Table 1:   i W   (92 >   60)   E   i   (94 >   60)   3   i   (92 >   60) 2   =  111   3   105 2   = 3 ,  i W   (92 >   60)   E   i   (90 >   60)   3   i   (92 >   60)  3 2   =  100   3   105  3 2   = 2 = 5 . Averaging these values, we estimate   i W   (92 >   60)   to be approximately   2 = 75 . Thus, when the actual temperature is   92  F   and the relative humidity is   60% , the apparent temperature rises by about   2 = 75  F   for every degree that the actual temperature rises. Similarly,   i K   (92 >   60) = lim  k < 0  i   (92 >   60 +   k )   3   i   (92 >   60)  k   which we can approximate by considering   k   = 5   and   k   =   3 5 :  i K   (92 >   60)   E   i (92 >   65)   3   i   (92 >   60) 5   =  108   3   105 5   = 0 = 6 ,   i K   (92 >   60)   E   i   (92 >   55)   3   i (92 >   60)  3 5   =  103   3   105  3 5   = 0 = 4 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(a) By De fi nition 4,   i W   ( 3 15 >   30) = lim  k < 0  i   ( 3 15 +   k>   30)   3   i   ( 3 15 >   30)  k   , which we can approximate by considering   k   = 5  and   k   =   3 5   and using the values given in the table:  i W   ( 3 15 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 10 >   30)   3   i   ( 3 15 >   30) 5   =   3 20   3   ( 3 26) 5   =  6 5  = 1 = 2 ,  i W   ( 3 15 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 20 >   30)   3   i   ( 3 15 >   30)  3 5   =   3 33   3   ( 3 26)  3 5   =   3 7  3 5  = 1 = 4 . Averaging these values, we estimate  i W   ( 3 15 >   30)   to be approximately   1 = 3 . Thus, when the actual temperature is   3 15  C   and the wind speed is   30   km @ h, the apparent temperature rises by about   1 = 3  C   for every degree that the actual temperature rises. Similarly,   i y   ( 3 15 >   30) = lim  k < 0  i   ( 3 15 >   30 +   k )   3   i   ( 3 15 >   30)  k   which we can approximate by considering   k   = 10  and   k   =   3 10 :   i y   ( 3 15 >   30)   E   i ( 3 15 >   40)   3   i   ( 3 15 >   30) 10   =   3 27   3   ( 3 26) 10   =   3 1 10  =   3 0 = 1 ,  i y   ( 3 15 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 15 >   20)   3   i   ( 3 15 >   30)  3 10   =   3 24   3   ( 3 26)  3 10   =   2  3 10  =   3 0 = 2 . Averaging these values, we estimate  i y   ( 3 15 >   30)   to be approximately   3 0 = 15 . Thus, when the actual temperature is   3 15  C   and the wind speed is   30   km @ h, the apparent temperature decreases by about   0 = 15  C   for every km @ h that the wind speed increases. (b) For a   fi xed wind speed   y , the values of the wind-chill index   Z   increase as temperature   W   increases (look at a column of the table), so   CZ CW   is positive. For a   fi xed temperature   W   , the values of   Z   decrease (or remain constant) as   y   increases (look at a row of the table), so   CZ Cy   is negative (or perhaps 0). (c) For   fi xed values of   W   , the function values   i   ( W> y )   appear to become constant (or nearly constant) as   y   increases, so the corresponding rate of change is   0   or near   0   as   y   increases. This suggests that   lim  y <"   ( CZ@Cy ) = 0 .  4.   (a)   Ck@Cy   represents the rate of change of   k   when we   fi x   w   and consider   k   as a function of   y , which describes how quickly the wave heights change when the wind speed changes for a   fi xed time duration.   Ck@Cw   represents the rate of change of   k  when we   fi x   y   and consider   k   as a function of   w , which describes how quickly the wave heights change when the duration of time changes, but the wind speed is constant. (b) By De fi nition 4,   i y   (40 >   15) = lim  k < 0  i   (40 +   k>   15)   3   i   (40 >   15)  k   which we can approximate by considering  k   = 10   and   k   =   3 10   and using the values given in the table:   i y   (40 >   15)   E   i   (50 >   15)   3   i (40 >   15) 10   =  36   3   25 10   = 1 = 1 ,  i y   (40 >   15)   E   i   (30 >   15)   3   i   (40 >   15)  3 10   =  16   3   25  3 10   = 0 = 9 . Averaging these values, we have   i y   (40 >   15)   E   1 = 0 . Thus, when a   40 -knot wind has been blowing for   15   hours, the wave heights should increase by about   1   foot for every knot that the  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Similarly,   i w (40 >   15) = lim  k < 0  i   (40 >   15 +   k )   3   i   (40 >   15)  k   which we can approximate by considering   k   = 5   and   k   =   3 5 :   i w (40 >   15)   E   i (40 >   20)   3   i   (40 >   15) 5   =  28   3   25 5   = 0 = 6 ,  i w (40 >   15)   E   i   (40 >   10)   3   i   (40 >   15)  3 5   =  21   3   25  3 5   = 0 = 8 . Averaging these values, we have   i w (40 >   15)   E   0 = 7 . Thus, when a  40 -knot wind has been blowing for   15   hours, the wave heights increase by about   0 = 7   feet for every additional hour that the wind blows. (c) For   fi xed values of   y , the function values   i ( y> w )   appear to increase in smaller and smaller increments, becoming nearly constant as   w   increases. Thus, the corresponding rate of change is nearly   0   as   w   increases, suggesting that  lim  w <" ( Ck@Cw ) = 0 .  5.   (a) If we start at   (1 >   2)   and move in the positive   { -direction, the graph of   i   increases. Thus   i { (1 >   2)   is positive. (b) If we start at   (1 >   2)   and move in the positive   | -direction, the graph of   i   decreases. Thus   i |   (1 >   2)   is negative.  6.   (a) The graph of   i   decreases if we start at   ( 3 1 >   2)   and move in the positive   { -direction, so   i { ( 3 1 >   2)   is negative. (b) The graph of   i   decreases if we start at   ( 3 1 >   2)   and move in the positive   | -direction, so   i |   ( 3 1 >   2)   is negative.  7.   (a)   i {{   =   C C{   ( i { ) , so   i {{   is the rate of change of   i {   in the   { -direction.   i {   is negative at   ( 3 1 >   2)   and if we move in the positive   { -direction, the surface becomes less steep. Thus the values of   i {   are increasing and   i {{ ( 3 1 >   2)   is positive. (b)   i ||   is the rate of change of   i |   in the   | -direction.   i |   is negative at   ( 3 1 >   2)   and if we move in the positive   | -direction, the surface becomes steeper. Thus the values of   i |   are decreasing, and   i ||   ( 3 1 >   2)   is negative.  8.   (a)   i {|   =   C C|   ( i { ) , so   i {|   is the rate of change of   i {   in the   | -direction.   i {   is positive at   (1 >   2)   and if we move in the positive  | -direction, the surface becomes steeper, looking in the positive   { -direction. Thus the values of   i {   are increasing and  i {|   (1 >   2)   is positive. (b)   i {   is negative at   ( 3 1 >   2)   and if we move in the positive   | -direction, the surface gets steeper (with negative slope), looking in the positive   { -direction. This means that the values of   i {   are decreasing as   |   increases, so   i {|   ( 3 1 >   2)   is negative.  9.   First of all, if we start at the point   (3 >   3 3)   and move in the positive   | -direction, we see that both   e   and   f   decrease, while   d  increases. Both   e   and   f   have a low point at about   (3 >   3 1 = 5) , while   d   is   0   at this point. So   d   is de fi nitely the graph of   i |   , and one of   e   and   f   is the graph of   i   . To see which is which, we start at the point   ( 3 3 >   3 1 = 5)   and move in the positive   { -direction.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

This tells us that   e   is the   { -derivative of   f . So   f   is the graph of   i ,   e   is the graph of   i { , and   d   is the graph of   i |   .  10.   i { (2 >   1)   is the rate of change of   i   at   (2 >   1)   in the   { -direction. If we start at   (2 >   1) , where   i   (2 >   1) = 10 , and move in the positive   { -direction, we reach the next contour line   [ where   i   ( {> | ) = 12]   after approximately   0 = 6   units. This represents an average rate of change of about   2 0 = 6   . If we approach the point   (2 >   1)   from the left (moving in the positive   { -direction) the output values increase from   8   to   10   with an increase in   {   of approximately   0 = 9   units, corresponding to an average rate of change of   2 0 = 9   . A good estimate for   i { (2 >   1)   would be the average of these two, so   i { (2 >   1)   E   2 = 8 . Similarly,   i |   (2 >   1)   is the rate of change of   i   at   (2 >   1)   in the   | -direction. If we approach   (2 >   1)   from below, the output values decrease from 12 to 10 with a change in   |   of approximately   1   unit, corresponding to an average rate of change of   3 2 . If we start at   (2 >   1)   and move in the positive   | -direction, the output values decrease from 10 to 8 after approximately 0.9 units, a rate of change of   3 2 0 = 9   . Averaging these two results, we estimate   i |   (2 >   1)   E 3 2 = 1 .  11.   i   ( {> | ) = 16   3   4 { 2   3   | 2   i   i { ( {> | ) =   3 8 {   and   i |   ( {> | ) =   3 2 |   i   i { (1 >   2) =   3 8   and   i |   (1 >   2) =   3 4 .

The slope of the tangent line to this parabola at   (1 >   2 >   8)   is   i { (1 >   2) =   3 8 . Similarly the plane   {   = 1   intersects the paraboloid in the parabola  }   = 12   3   | 2 ,   {   = 1   (the curve   F 2   in the second   fi gure) and the slope of the tangent line at   (1 >   2 >   8)   is   i |   (1 >   2) =   3 4 .  12.   i   ( {> | ) = (4   3   { 2   3   4 | 2 ) 1 @ 2   i   i { ( {> | ) =   3 { (4   3   { 2   3   4 | 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   and   i |   ( {> | ) =   3 4 | (4   3   { 2   3   4 | 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   i  i { (1 >   0) =   3   1 I 3   ,   i |   (1 >   0) = 0 .

Assuming that the third partial derivatives of   i   are continuous (easily veri fi ed), we can write   i {}|   =   i |{}   .

Let   i ( {> |> } ) =   I 1 +   {}   and   k ( {> |> } ) =   I 1   3   {|   so that   j   =   i   +   k . Then   i |   = 0 =   i |{   =   i |{}   and  k }   = 0 =   k }{   =   k }{|   . But (since the partial derivatives are continous on their domains)   i {|}   =   i |{}   and   k {|}   =   k }{|   , so  j {|}   =   i {|}   +   k {|}   = 0 + 0 = 0 .  73.   By De fi nition 4,   i { (3 >   2) = lim  k < 0  i (3 +   k>   2)   3   i   (3 >   2)  k   which we can approximate by considering   k   = 0 = 5   and   k   =   3 0 = 5 :  i { (3 >   2)   E   i   (3 = 5 >   2)   3   i (3 >   2) 0 = 5   =  22 = 4   3   17 = 5 0 = 5   = 9 = 8 ,   i { (3 >   2)   E   i   (2 = 5 >   2)   3   i   (3 >   2)  3 0 = 5   =  10 = 2   3   17 = 5  3 0 = 5   = 14 = 6 . Averaging these values, we estimate   i { (3 >   2)   to be approximately   12 = 2 . Similarly,   i { (3 >   2 = 2) = lim  k < 0  i (3 +   k>   2 = 2)   3   i   (3 >   2 = 2)  k   which we can approximate by considering   k   = 0 = 5   and   k   =   3 0 = 5 :   i { (3 >   2 = 2)   E   i   (3 = 5 >   2 = 2)   3   i   (3 >   2 = 2) 0 = 5   =  26 = 1   3   15 = 9 0 = 5   = 20 = 4 ,  i { (3 >   2 = 2)   E   i   (2 = 5 >   2 = 2)   3   i (3 >   2 = 2)  3 0 = 5   =  9 = 3   3   15 = 9  3 0 = 5   = 13 = 2 .

Now   i {|   ( {> | ) =   C C|   [ i { ( {> | )]   and   i { ( {> | )   is itself a function of two variables, so De fi nition 4 says that   i {|   ( {> | ) =   C C|   [ i { ( {> | )] = lim  k < 0  i { ( {> |   +   k )   3   i { ( {> | )  k   i  i {|   (3 >   2) = lim  k < 0  i { (3 >   2 +   k )   3   i { (3 >   2)  k   .

Averaging these values, we estimate   i {|   (3 >   2)   to be approximately   23 = 25 .  74.   (a) If we   fi x   |   and allow   {   to vary, the level curves indicate that the value of   i   decreases as we move through   S   in the positive  { -direction, so   i {   is negative at   S   .

Setting   {   = 1 , the equation of the parabola of intersection is  }   = 6   3   1   3   1   3   2 | 2   = 4   3   2 | 2 . The slope of the tangent is  C}@C|   =   3 4 | , so at   (1 >   2 >   3 4)   the slope is   3 8 . Parametric equations for the line are therefore   {   = 1 ,   |   = 2 +   w ,  }   =   3 4   3   8 w .  95.   By the geometry of partial derivatives, the slope of the tangent line is   i { (1 >   2) . By implicit differentiation of  4 { 2   + 2 | 2   +   } 2   = 16 , we get   8 {   + 2 }   ( C}@C{ ) = 0   i   C}@C{   =   3 4 {@} , so when   {   = 1   and   }   = 2   we have  C}@C{   =   3 2 . So the slope is   i { (1 >   2) =   3 2 . Thus the tangent line is given by   }   3   2 =   3 2( {   3   1) ,   |   = 2 . Taking the parameter to be   w   =   {   3   1 , we can write parametric equations for this line:   {   = 1 +   w ,   |   = 2 ,   }   = 2   3   2 w .  96.   W   ( {> w ) =   W 0   +   W 1 h 3 {   sin( $w   3   { )  (a)   CW @C{   =   W 1 h 3 {   [cos( $w   3   { )( 3  )] +   W 1 ( 3 h 3 { ) sin( $w   3   { ) =   3 W 1 h 3 {   [sin( $w   3   { ) + cos( $w   3   { )] . This quantity represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to depth below the surface, at a given time   w . (b)   CW @Cw   =   W 1 h 3 {   [cos( $w   3   { )( $ )] =   $W 1 h 3 {   cos( $w   3   { ) . This quantity represents the rate of change of temperature with respect to time at a   fi xed depth   { . (c)   W {{   =   C C{     CW C{    =   3 W 1   h 3 {   [cos( $w   3   { )( 3  )   3   sin( $w   3   { )( 3  )] +   h 3 { ( 3  ) [sin( $w   3   { ) + cos( $w   3   { )]   = 2  2 W 1 h 3 {   cos( $w   3   { )  But from part (b),   W w   =   $W 1 h 3 {   cos( $w   3   { ) =   $  2  2   W {{ . So with   n   =   $  2  2   , the function   W   satis fi es the heat equation. (d)   Note that near the surface (that is, for small   { ) the temperature varies greatly as   w   changes, but deeper (for large   { ) the temperature is more stable. (e) The term   3 {   is a phase shift: it represents the fact that since heat diffuses slowly through soil, it takes time for changes in the surface temperature to affect the temperature at deeper points. As   {   increases, the phase shift also increases. For example, when      = 0 = 2 , the highest temperature at the surface is reached when   w   E   91 , whereas at a depth of   5   feet the peak temperature is attained at   w   E   149 , and at a depth of   10   feet, at   w   E   207 .  97.   By Clairaut’s Theorem,   i {||   = ( i {|   ) |   = ( i |{ ) |   =   i |{|   = ( i |   ) {|   = ( i |   ) |{   =   i ||{ .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(a) Since we are differentiating   q   times, with two choices of variable at each differentiation, there are   2 q   q th-order partial derivatives. (b) If these partial derivatives are all continuous, then the order in which the partials are taken doesn’t affect the value of the result, that is, all   q th-order partial derivatives with   s   partials with respect to   {   and   q   3   s   partials with respect to   |   are equal. Since the number of partials taken with respect to   {   for an   q th-order partial derivative can range from   0   to   q , a function of two variables has   q   + 1   distinct partial derivatives of order   q   if these partial derivatives are all continuous. (c) Since   q   differentiations are to be performed with three choices of variable at each differentiation, there are   3 q   q th-order partial derivatives of a function of three variables.  99.   Let   j ( { ) =   i   ( {>   0) =   { ( { 2 ) 3 3 @ 2 h 0   =   {   | { | 3 3 . But we are using the point   (1 >   0) , so near   (1 >   0) ,   j ( { ) =   { 3 2 . Then  j 0 ( { ) =   3 2 { 3 3   and   j 0 (1) =   3 2 , so using (1) we have   i { (1 >   0) =   j 0 (1) =   3 2 .  100.   i { (0 >   0) = lim  k < 0  i   (0 +   k>   0)   3   i   (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  ( k 3   + 0) 1 @ 3   3   0  k   = lim  k < 0  k k   = 1 .  Or:   Let   j ( { ) =   i   ( {>   0) =   3  I { 3   + 0 =   { . Then   j 0 ( { ) = 1   and   j 0 (0) = 1   so, by (1),   i { (0 >   0) =   j 0 (0) = 1 .  101.

(d) By (3),   i {|   (0 >   0) =   Ci {  C|   = lim  k < 0  i { (0 > k )   3   i { (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  ( 3 k 5   3   0) @k 4  k   =   3 1   while by (2),  i |{ (0 >   0) =   Ci |  C{   = lim  k < 0  i |   ( k>   0)   3   i |   (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  k 5 @k 4  k   = 1 . (e) For   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) , we use a CAS to compute  i {|   ( {> | ) =   { 6   + 9 { 4 | 2   3   9 { 2 | 4   3   | 6  ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 3  Now as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along the   { -axis,   i {|   ( {> | )   <   1   while as  ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along the   | -axis,   i {|   ( {> | )   < 3 1 . Thus   i {|   isn’t continuous at   (0 >   0)   and Clairaut’s Theorem doesn’t apply, so there is no contradiction. The graphs of   i {|   and   i |{   are identical except at the origin, where we observe the discontinuity.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The partial derivatives are   i { ( {> | ) = (1 @| ) cos( {@| )   and   i |   ( {> | ) = 1 + ( 3 {@| 2 ) cos( {@| ) , so  i { (0 >   3) =   1 3   and   i |   (0 >   3) = 1 . Both   i {   and   i |   are continuous functions for   |   6   = 0 , so   i   is differentiable at   (0 >   3) , and the linearization of   i   at   (0 >   3)   is  O ( {> | ) =   i   (0 >   3) +   i { (0 >   3)( {   3   0) +   i |   (0 >   3)( |   3   3) = 3 +   1 3   ( {   3   0) + 1( |   3   3) =   1 3   {   +   | .  17.   Let   i   ( {> | ) =  2 {   + 3 4 |   + 1   . Then   i { ( {> | ) =   2 4 |   + 1   and   i |   ( {> | ) = (2 {   + 3)( 3 1)(4 |   + 1) 3 2 (4) =   3 8 {   3   12 (4 |   + 1) 2   . Both   i {   and   i |  are continuous functions for   |   6   =   3   1 4   , so by Theorem 8,   i   is differentiable at   (0 >   0) . We have   i { (0 >   0) = 2 ,   i |   (0 >   0) =   3 12  and the linear approximation of   i   at   (0 >   0)   is   i   ( {> | )   E   i   (0 >   0) +   i { (0 >   0)( {   3   0) +   i |   (0 >   0)( |   3   0) = 3 + 2 {   3   12 | .  18.

Both   i {   and   i |   are continuous functions for   | A   3   cos 2   { , so   i  is differentiable at   (0 >   0)   by Theorem 8. We have   i { (0 >   0) = 0   and   i |   (0 >   0) =   1 2   , so the linear approximation of   i   at   (0 >   0)   is  i   ( {> | )   E   i   (0 >   0) +   i { (0 >   0)( {   3   0) +   i |   (0 >   0)( |   3   0) = 1 + 0 {   +   1 2   |   = 1 +   1 2   | .  19.   We can estimate   i (2 = 2 >   4 = 9)   using a linear approximation of   i   at   (2 >   5) , given by  i   ( {> | )   E   i (2 >   5) +   i { (2 >   5)( {   3   2) +   i |   (2 >   5)( |   3   5) = 6 + 1( {   3   2) + ( 3 1)( |   3   5) =   {   3   |   + 9 .

From the table,   i   (40 >   20) = 28 . To estimate   i y   (40 >   20)   and   i w (40 >   20)   we follow the procedure used in Exercise 14.3.4. Since  i y   (40 >   20) = lim  k < 0  i   (40 +   k>   20)   3   i   (40 >   20)  k   , we approximate this quantity with   k   =   ± 10   and use the values given in the table:  i y   (40 >   20)   E   i   (50 >   20)   3   i   (40 >   20) 10   =  40   3   28 10   = 1 = 2 ,   i y   (40 >   20)   E   i   (30 >   20)   3   i   (40 >   20)  3 10   =  17   3   28  3 10   = 1 = 1  Averaging these values gives   i y   (40 >   20)   E   1 = 15 . Similarly,   i w (40 >   20) = lim  k < 0  i   (40 >   20 +   k )   3   i   (40 >   20)  k   , so we use   k   = 10  and   k   =   3 5 :  i w (40 >   20)   E   i   (40 >   30)   3   i (40 >   20) 10   =  31   3   28 10   = 0 = 3 ,   i w (40 >   20)   E   i   (40 >   15)   3   i (40 >   20)  3 5   =  25   3   28  3 5   = 0 = 6  Averaging these values gives   i w (40 >   15)   E   0 = 45 . The linear approximation, then, is  i   ( y> w )   E   i   (40 >   20) +   i y   (40 >   20)( y   3   40) +   i w (40 >   20)( w   3   20)   E   28 + 1 = 15( y   3   40) + 0 = 45( w   3   20)  When   y   = 43   and   w   = 24 , we estimate   i   (43 >   24)   E   28 + 1 = 15(43   3   40) + 0 = 45(24   3   20) = 33 = 25 , so we would expect the wave heights to be approximately   33 = 25   ft.  23.

Similarly,   i K   (94 >   80) = lim  k < 0  i   (94 >   80 +   k )   3   i   (94 >   80)  k   , so we use   k   =   ± 5 :  i K   (94 >   80)   E   i   (94 >   85)   3   i   (94 >   80) 5   =  132   3   127 5   = 1 ,   i K   (94 >   80)   E   i (94 >   75)   3   i   (94 >   80)  3 5   =  122   3   127  3 5   = 1  Averaging these values gives   i K   (94 >   80)   E   1 . The linear approximation, then, is  i   ( W> K )   E   i   (94 >   80) +   i W   (94 >   80)( W   3   94) +   i K   (94 >   80)( K   3   80)  E   127 + 4( W   3   94) + 1( K   3   80)   [or   4 W   +   K   3   329 ] Thus when   W   = 95   and   K   = 78 ,   i   (95 >   78)   E   127 + 4(95   3   94) + 1(78   3   80) = 129 , so we estimate the heat index to be approximately   129  F .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Thus the pressure will drop by about   8 = 83 kPa .  39.   First we   fi nd   CU CU 1  implicitly by taking partial derivatives of both sides with respect to   U 1 :  C CU 1     1  U    =   C   [(1 @U 1 ) + (1 @U 2 ) + (1 @U 3 )]  CU 1  i   3 U 3 2   CU CU 1  =   3 U 3 2 1   i   CU CU 1  =   U 2  U 2 1  . Then by symmetry,  CU CU 2  =   U 2  U 2 2  ,   CU CU 3  =   U 2  U 2 3  . When   U 1   = 25 ,   U 2   = 40   and   U 3   = 50 ,   1  U   =   17 200   C   U   =   200 17   l . Since the possible error for each   U l   is   0 = 5% , the maximum error of   U   is attained by setting   { U l   = 0 = 005 U l . So  { U   E   gU   =   CU CU 1  { U 1   +   CU CU 2  { U 2   +   CU CU 3  { U 3   = (0 = 005) U 2     1  U 1  +   1  U 2  +   1  U 3    = (0 = 005) U   =   1 17   E   0 = 059   l .  40.   Let   {> |> }   and   z   be the four numbers with   s ( {> |> }> z ) =   {|}z . Since the largest error due to rounding for each number is   0 = 05 , the maximum error in the calculated product is approximated by  gs   = ( |}z )(0 = 05) + ( {}z )(0 = 05) + ( {|z )(0 = 05) + ( {|} )(0 = 05) . Furthermore, each of the numbers is positive but less than  50 , so the product of any three is between   0   and   (50) 3 . Thus   gs   $   4(50) 3 (0 = 05) = 25 , 000 .  41.   The errors in measurement are at most   2% , so        { z z        $   0 = 02   and        { k k        $   0 = 02 .

Thus the maximum percentage error is approximately   2 = 3% .  42.   r 1 ( w ) =   2 + 3 w>   1   3   w 2 >   3   3   4 w   +   w 2    i   r 0  1 ( w ) =   h 3 >   3 2 w>   3 4 + 2 w i ,   r 2 ( x ) =   1 +   x 2 >   2 x 3   3   1 >   2 x   + 1    i  r 0  2 ( x ) =   2 x>   6 x 2 >   2  .

Hence   i   is differentiable.  45.   To show that   i   is continuous at   ( d> e )   we need to show that   lim  ( {>| ) < ( d>e )   i   ( {> | ) =   i   ( d> e )   or equivalently   lim  ( { {> { | ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( d   +   { {> e   +   { | ) =   i   ( d> e ) . Since   i   is differentiable at   ( d> e ) ,  i   ( d   +   { {> e   +   { | )   3   i   ( d> e ) =   { }   =   i { ( d> e )   { {   +   i |   ( d> e )   { |   +   % 1   { {   +   % 2   { | , where    1   and    2   <   0   as  ( { {>   { | )   <   (0 >   0) . Thus   i   ( d   +   { {> e   +   { | ) =   i ( d> e ) +   i { ( d> e )   { {   +   i |   ( d> e )   { |   +   % 1   { {   +   % 2   { | . Taking the limit of both sides as   ( { {>   { | )   <   (0 >   0)   gives   lim  ( { {> { | ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( d   +   { {> e   +   { | ) =   i   ( d> e ) . Thus   i   is continuous at   ( d> e ) .  46.   (a)   lim  k < 0  i   ( k>   0)   3   i   (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  0   3   0  k   = 0   and   lim  k < 0  i   (0 > k )   3   i   (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  0   3   0  k   = 0 . Thus   i { (0 >   0) =   i |   (0 >   0) = 0 . To show that   i   isn’t differentiable at   (0 >   0)   we need only show that   i   is not continuous at   (0 >   0)   and apply Exercise 45. As  ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along the   { -axis   i   ( {> | ) = 0 @{ 2   = 0   for   {   6   = 0   so   i   ( {> | )   <   0   as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along the   { -axis. But as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along the line   |   =   { ,   i   ( {> { ) =   { 2 @  2 { 2    =   1 2   for   {   6   = 0   so   i   ( {> | )   <   1 2   as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0)   along this line. Thus   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)   i   ( {> | )   doesn’t exist, so   i   is discontinuous at   (0 >   0)   and thus not differentiable there. (b) For   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) ,   i { ( {> | ) =  ( { 2   +   | 2 ) |   3   {| (2 { ) ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 2   =   | ( | 2   3   { 2 ) ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 2   . If we approach   (0 >   0)   along the   | -axis, then  i { ( {> | ) =   i { (0 > | ) =   | 3  | 4   =  1  |   , so   i { ( {> | )   <   ± "   as   ( {> | )   <   (0 >   0) . Thus   lim  ( {>| ) < (0 > 0)   i { ( {> | )   does not exist and  i { ( {> | )   is not continuous at   (0 >   0) =   Similarly,   i |   ( {> | ) =  ( { 2   +   | 2 ) {   3   {| (2 | ) ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 2   =   { ( { 2   3   | 2 ) ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 2   for   ( {> | )   6   = (0 >   0) , and if we approach   (0 >   0)   along the   { -axis, then   i |   ( {> | ) =   i { ( {>   0) =   { 3  { 4   =  1  {   .

(a) Since   CZ@CW   is negative, a rise in average temperature (while annual rainfall remains constant) causes a decrease in wheat production at the current production levels. Since   CZ@CU   is positive, an increase in annual rainfall (while the average temperature remains constant) causes an increase in wheat production. (b) Since the average temperature is rising at a rate of   0 = 15  C @ year, we know that   gW @gw   = 0 = 15 . Since rainfall is decreasing at a rate of   0 = 1   cm @ year, we know   gU@gw   =   3 0 = 1 . Then, by the Chain Rule,  gZ gw   =   CZ CW gW gw   +   CZ CU gU gw   = ( 3 2)(0 = 15) + (8)( 3 0 = 1) =   3 1 = 1 . Thus we estimate that wheat production will decrease at a rate of   1 = 1   units @ year.  37.   F   = 1449 = 2 + 4 = 6 W   3   0 = 055 W   2   + 0 = 00029 W   3   + 0 = 016 G , so   CF CW   = 4 = 6   3   0 = 11 W   + 0 = 00087 W   2   and   CF CG   = 0 = 016 . According to the graph, the diver is experiencing a temperature of approximately   12 = 5  C   at   w   = 20   minutes, so  CF CW   = 4 = 6   3   0 = 11(12 = 5) + 0 = 00087(12 = 5) 2   E   3 = 36 . By sketching tangent lines at   w   = 20   to the graphs given, we estimate  gG gw   E   1 2   and   gW gw   E 3   1 10   . Then, by the Chain Rule,   gF gw   =   CF CW gW gw   +   CF CG gG gw   E   (3 = 36)  3   1 10     + (0 = 016)    1 2     E 3 0 = 33 .

The area   D   of the triangle is given by  D   =   1 2   {|   sin      where      is the angle between the two sides.

But   C} C|   = 0   and   C| C|   = 1 , so   I {  C{ C|   +   I |   = 0   i   C{ C|   =   3   I |  I {  . A similar calculation shows that   C| C}   =   3   I }  I |  . Thus   C} C{ C{ C| C| C}   =    3   I {  I }    3   I |  I {    3   I }  I |    =   3 1 .  59.   Given a function de fi ned implicitly by   I   ( {> | ) = 0 , where   I   is differentiable and   I |   6   = 0 , we know that   g| g{   =   3   I {  I |  . Let  J ( {> | ) =   3   I {  I |  so   g| g{   =   J ( {> | ) . Differentiating both sides with respect to   {   and using the Chain Rule gives  g 2 | g{ 2   =   CJ C{ g{ g{   +   CJ C| g| g{   where   CJ C{   =   C C{    3   I {  I |    =   3   I |   I {{   3   I { I |{  I   2  |  ,   CJ C|   =   C C|    3   I {  I |    =   3   I |   I {|   3   I { I ||  I   2  |  .

We can approximate the directional derivative of the pressure function at K in the direction of S by the average rate of change of pressure between the points where the red line intersects the contour lines closest to K (extend the red line slightly at the left). In the direction of S, the pressure changes from   1000   millibars to   996   millibars and we estimate the distance between these two points to be approximately   50   km (using the fact that the distance from K to S is 300 km). Then the rate of change of pressure in the direction given is approximately   996   3   1000 50   =   3 0 = 08   millibar @ km.  2.   First we draw a line passing through Dubbo and Sydney. We approximate the directional derivative at Dubbo in the direction of Sydney by the average rate of change of temperature between the points where the line intersects the contour lines closest to Dubbo. In the direction of Sydney, the temperature changes from   30  C   to   27  C . We estimate the distance between these two points to be approximately   120   km, so the rate of change of maximum temperature in the direction given is approximately  27   3   30 120   =   3 0 = 025  C @ km.  3.   G u   i   ( 3 20 >   30) =   Q i   ( 3 20 >   30)   ·   u   =   i W   ( 3 20 >   30)     1 I 2    +   i y   ( 3 20 >   30)     1 I 2    .  i W   ( 3 20 >   30) = lim  k < 0  i ( 3 20 +   k>   30)   3   i ( 3 20 >   30)  k   , so we can approximate   i W   ( 3 20 >   30)   by considering   k   =   ± 5   and using the values given in the table:   i W   ( 3 20 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 15 >   30)   3   i   ( 3 20 >   30) 5   =   3 26   3   ( 3 33) 5   = 1 = 4 ,  i W   ( 3 20 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 25 >   30)   3   i   ( 3 20 >   30)  3 5   =   3 39   3   ( 3 33)  3 5   = 1 = 2 . Averaging these values gives   i W   ( 3 20 >   30)   E   1 = 3 . Similarly,   i y   ( 3 20 >   30) = lim  k < 0  i   ( 3 20 >   30 +   k )   3   i   ( 3 20 >   30)  k   , so we can approximate   i y   ( 3 20 >   30)   with   k   =   ± 10 :  i y   ( 3 20 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 20 >   40)   3   i ( 3 20 >   30) 10   =   3 34   3   ( 3 33) 10   =   3 0 = 1 ,  i y   ( 3 20 >   30)   E   i   ( 3 20 >   20)   3   i   ( 3 20 >   30)  3 10   =   3 30   3   ( 3 33)  3 10   =   3 0 = 3 . Averaging these values gives   i y   ( 3 20 >   30)   E 3 0 = 2 .

(a) As in the proof of Theorem 15,   G u   i   =   | Q i   |   cos    . Since the minimum value of   cos      is   3 1   occurring when      =    , the minimum value of   G u   i   is   3   | Q i   |   occurring when      =    , that is when   u   is in the opposite direction of   Q i  (assuming   Q i   6   =   0 ). (b)   i   ( {> | ) =   { 4 |   3   { 2 | 3   i   Q i   ( {> | ) =   4 { 3 |   3   2 {| 3 > { 4   3   3 { 2 | 2  , so   i   decreases fastest at the point   (2 >   3 3)   in the direction   3Q i   (2 >   3 3) =   3   h 12 >   3 92 i   =   h 3 12 >   92 i .  28.   i   ( {> | ) =   |h 3 {|   i   i { ( {> | ) =   |h 3 {|   ( 3 | ) =   3 | 2 h 3 {|   ,   i |   ( {> | ) =   |h 3 {|   ( 3 { ) +   h 3 {|   = (1   3   {| ) h 3 {|   and  i { (0 >   2) =   3 4 h 0   =   3 4 ,   i |   (0 >   2) = (1   3   0) h 0   = 1 .

The direction of fastest change is   Q i   ( {> | ) = (2 {   3   2)   i   + (2 |   3   4)   j , so we need to   fi nd all points   ( {> | )   where   Q i   ( {> | )   is parallel to   i   +   j   C   (2 {   3   2)   i   + (2 |   3   4)   j   =   n   ( i   +   j )   C   n   = 2 {   3   2   and   n   = 2 |   3   4 . Then   2 {   3   2 = 2 |   3   4   i  |   =   {   + 1 >   so the direction of fastest change is   i   +   j   at all points on the line   |   =   {   + 1 .  30.

Since   G u   i   (80 >   60)   is positive, the depth of the lake is increasing near   (80 >   60)   in the direction toward the buoy.  31.

Thus, if you walk due south from   (60 >   40 >   966)  you will ascend at a rate of   0 = 8   vertical meters per horizontal meter.

Thus, if you walk northwest from   (60 >   40 >   966)   you will descend at a rate of approximately   0 = 14   vertical meters per horizontal meter. (c)   Q i   (60 >   40) =   h 3 0 = 6 >   3 0 = 8 i   is the direction of largest slope with a rate of ascent given by  | Q i   (60 >   40) |   =   s ( 3 0 = 6) 2   + ( 3 0 = 8) 2   = 1 . The angle above the horizontal in which the path begins is given by  tan      = 1   i      = 45    .  35.   A unit vector in the direction of   3 <  DE   is   i   and a unit vector in the direction of   3 <  DF   is   j . Thus   G 3 3 <  DE   i   (1 >   3) =   i { (1 >   3) = 3   and  G 3 3 <  DF   i (1 >   3) =   i |   (1 >   3) = 26 .

The curves of steepest ascent or descent are perpendicular to all of the contour lines (see Figure 12) so we sketch curves beginning at A and B that head toward lower elevations, crossing each contour line at a right angle.  37.

If we place the initial point of the gradient vector   Q i   (4 >   6)   at   (4 >   6) , the vector is perpendicular to the level curve of   i   that includes   (4 >   6) , so we sketch a portion of the level curve through   (4 >   6)   (using the nearby level curves as a guideline) and draw a line perpendicular to the curve at   (4 >   6) . The gradient vector is parallel to this line, pointing in the direction of increasing function values, and with length equal to the maximum value of the directional derivative of   i   at  (4 >   6) . We can estimate this length by   fi nding the average rate of change in the direction of the gradient. The line intersects the contour lines corresponding to  3 2   and   3 3   with an estimated distance of   0 = 5   units. Thus the rate of change is approximately   3 2   3   ( 3 3) 0 = 5   = 2 , and we sketch the gradient vector with length   2 .  39.   i   ( {> | ) =   { 3   + 5 { 2 |   +   | 3   i  G u i ( {> | ) =   Q i   ( {> | )   ·   u   =   3 { 2   + 10 {|>   5 { 2   + 3 | 2    ·   3 5   >   4 5     =   9 5   { 2   + 6 {|   + 4 { 2   +   12 5   | 2   =   29 5   { 2   + 6 {|   +   12 5   | 2 .

Q I   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) =     2 { 0  d 2   >   2 | 0  e 2   >   3 1  f   , so an equation of the tangent plane is   2 { 0  d 2   {   +  2 | 0  e 2   |   3   1  f  }   =  2 { 2 0  d 2   +  2 | 2 0  e 2   3   } 0  f  or   2 { 0  d 2   {   +  2 | 0  e 2   |   =   } f   + 2     { 2 0  d 2   +   | 2 0  e 2    3   } 0  f   . But   } 0  f   =   { 2 0  d 2   +   | 2 0  e 2   , so the equation can be written as  2 { 0  d 2   {   +  2 | 0  e 2   |   =   }   +   } 0  f   .  54.   Let   I   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   } 2   3   | ; then the paraboloid   |   =   { 2   +   } 2   is a level surface of   I   .   Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h 2 {>   3 1 >   2 } i   is a normal vector to the surface at   ( {> |> } )   and so it is a normal vector for the tangent plane there. The tangent plane is parallel to the plane   {   + 2 |   + 3 }   = 1   when the normal vectors of the planes are parallel, so we need a point   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   on the paraboloid where   h 2 { 0 >   3 1 >   2 } 0 i   =   n   h 1 >   2 >   3 i . Comparing   | -components we have   n   =   3   1 2   , so  h 2 { 0 >   3 1 >   2 } 0 i   =   3   1 2   >   3 1 >   3   3 2     and   2 { 0   =   3   1 2   i   { 0   =   3   1 4   ,   2 } 0   =   3   3 2   i   } 0   =   3   3 4   . Then  | 0   =   { 2 0   +   } 2 0   =    3   1 4   2   +    3   3 4   2   =   5 8   and the point is    3   1 4   >   5 8   >   3   3 4   .  55.   The hyperboloid   { 2   3   | 2   3   } 2   = 1   is a level surface of   I   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   3   | 2   3   } 2   and   Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h 2 {>   3 2 |>   3 2 } i   is a normal vector to the surface and hence a normal vector for the tangent plane at   ( {> |> } ) . The tangent plane is parallel to the plane   }   =   {   +   |   or   {   +   |   3   }   = 0   if and only if the corresponding normal vectors are parallel, so we need a point   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )  on the hyperboloid where   h 2 { 0 >   3 2 | 0 >   3 2 } 0 i   =   f   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i   or equivalently   h { 0 >   3 | 0 >   3 } 0 i   =   n   h 1 >   1 >   3 1 i   for some   n   6   = 0 . Then we must have   { 0   =   n ,   | 0   =   3 n ,   } 0   =   n   and substituting into the equation of the hyperboloid gives  n 2   3   ( 3 n ) 2   3   n 2   = 1   C   3 n 2   = 1 , an impossibility. Thus there is no such point on the hyperboloid.  56.   First note that the point   (1 >   1 >   2)   is on both surfaces. The ellipsoid is a level surface of   I   ( {> |> } ) = 3 { 2   + 2 | 2   +   } 2   and  Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h 6 {>   4 |>   2 } i . A normal vector to the surface at   (1 >   1 >   2)   is   Q I   (1 >   1 >   2) =   h 6 >   4 >   4 i   and an equation of the tangent plane there is   6( {   3   1) + 4( |   3   1) + 4( }   3   2) = 0   or   6 {   + 4 |   + 4 }   = 18   or   3 {   + 2 |   + 2 }   = 9 . The sphere is a level surface of   J ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   3   8 {   3   6 |   3   8 }   + 24   and   Q J ( {> |> } ) =   h 2 {   3   8 >   2 |   3   6 >   2 }   3   8 i . A normal vector to the sphere at   (1 >   1 >   2)   is   Q J (1 >   1 >   2) =   h 3 6 >   3 4 >   3 4 i   and the tangent plane there is   3 6( {   3   1)   3   4( |   3   1)   3   4( }   3   2) = 0   or  3 {   + 2 |   + 2 }   = 9 . Since these tangent planes are identical, the surfaces are tangent to each other at the point   (1 >   1 >   2) .  57.   Let   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   be a point on the cone [other than   (0 >   0 >   0) ]. The cone is a level surface of   I   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   3   } 2   and  Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h 2 {>   2 |>   3 2 } i , so   Q I   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) =   h 2 { 0 >   2 | 0 >   3 2 } 0 i   is a normal vector to the cone at this point and an equation of the tangent plane there is   2 { 0   ( {   3   { 0 ) + 2 | 0   ( |   3   | 0 )   3   2 } 0   ( }   3   } 0 ) = 0   or   { 0 {   +   | 0 |   3   } 0 }   =   { 2 0   +   | 2 0   3   } 2 0   . But   { 2 0   +   | 2 0   =   } 2 0   so the tangent plane is given by   { 0 {   +   | 0 |   3   } 0 }   = 0 , a plane which always contains the origin.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Then the normal line is given by   {   3   { 0  2 { 0  =   |   3   | 0  2 | 0  =   }   3   } 0  2 } 0  . For the center  (0 >   0 >   0)   to be on the line, we need   3   { 0  2 { 0  =   3   | 0  2 | 0  =   3   } 0  2 } 0  or equivalently   1 = 1 = 1 , which is true.  59.   Let   I   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   3   } . Then the paraboloid is the level surface   I   ( {> |> } ) = 0   and   Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h 2 {>   2 |>   3 1 i , so  Q I   (1 >   1 >   2) =   h 2 >   2 >   3 1 i   is a normal vector to the surface. Thus the normal line at   (1 >   1 >   2)   is given by   {   = 1 + 2 w ,  |   = 1 + 2 w ,   }   = 2   3   w . Substitution into the equation of the paraboloid   }   =   { 2   +   | 2   gives   2   3   w   = (1 + 2 w ) 2   + (1 + 2 w ) 2   C  2   3   w   = 2 + 8 w   + 8 w 2   C   8 w 2   + 9 w   = 0   C   w (8 w   + 9) = 0 . Thus the line intersects the paraboloid when   w   = 0 , corresponding to the given point   (1 >   1 >   2) , or when   w   =   3   9 8   , corresponding to the point    3   5 4   >   3   5 4   >   25 8   .  60.   The ellipsoid is a level surface of   I   ( {> |> } ) = 4 { 2   +   | 2   + 4 } 2   and   Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h 8 {>   2 |>   8 } i , so   Q I   (1 >   2 >   1) =   h 8 >   4 >   8 i  or equivalently   h 2 >   1 >   2 i   is a normal vector to the surface. Thus the normal line to the ellipsoid at   (1 >   2 >   1)   is given by   {   = 1 + 2 w ,   |   = 2 +   w ,   }   = 1 + 2 w . Substitution into the equation of the sphere gives  (1 +2 w ) 2   +(2 + w ) 2   + (1 + 2 w ) 2   = 102   C   6 + 12 w + 9 w 2   = 102   C   9 w 2   + 12 w 3 96 = 0   C   3( w + 4)(3 w   3   8) = 0 . Thus the line intersects the sphere when   w   =   3 4 , corresponding to the point   ( 3 7 >   3 2 >   3 7) , and when   w   =   8 3   , corresponding to the point      19 3   >   14 3   >   19 3   .  61.   Let   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   be a point on the surface. Then an equation of the tangent plane at the point is  {  2   I { 0  +   |  2   I | 0  +   }  2   I } 0  =  I { 0   +   I | 0   +   I } 0  2   . But   I { 0   +   I | 0   +   I } 0   =   I f , so the equation is  {  I { 0  +   |  I | 0  +   }  I } 0  =   I f . The   { -,   | -, and   } -intercepts are   I f{ 0 ,   I f| 0   and   I f} 0   respectively. (The   { -intercept is found by setting   |   =   }   = 0   and solving the resulting equation for   { , and the   | - and   } -intercepts are found similarly.) So the sum of the intercepts is   I f  I { 0   +   I | 0   +   I } 0     =   f , a constant.  62.   The surface   {|}   = 1   is a level surface of   I   ( {> |> } ) =   {|}   and   Q I   ( {> |> } ) =   h |}> {}> {| i   is normal to the surface, so a normal vector for the tangent plane to the surface at   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   is   h | 0 } 0 > { 0 } 0 > { 0 | 0 i . An equation for the tangent plane there is   | 0 } 0 ( {   3   { 0 ) +   { 0 } 0 ( |   3   | 0 ) +   { 0 | 0 ( }   3   } 0 ) = 0   i   | 0 } 0 {   +   { 0 } 0 |   +   { 0 | 0 }   = 3 { 0 | 0 } 0   or   { { 0  +   | | 0  +   } } 0  = 3 . If   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   is in the   fi rst octant, then the tangent plane cuts off a pyramid in the   fi rst octant with vertices   (0 >   0 >   0) ,  (3 { 0 >   0 >   0) ,   (0 >   3 | 0 >   0) ,   (0 >   0 >   3 } 0 ) . The base in the   {| -plane is a triangle with area   1 2   (3 { 0 ) (3 | 0 )   and the height (along the  } -axis) of the pyramid is   3 } 0 . The volume of the pyramid for any point   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   on the surface   {|}   = 1   in the   fi rst octant is  1 3   ( base ) ( height ) =   1 3   ·   1 2   (3 { 0 ) (3 | 0 )   ·   3 } 0   =   9 2   { 0 | 0 } 0   =   9 2   since   { 0 | 0 } 0   = 1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

If   i   ( {> |> } ) =   }   3   { 2   3   | 2   and   j ( {> |> } ) = 4 { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 , then the tangent line is perpendicular to both   Q i   and   Q j  at   ( 3 1 >   1 >   2) . The vector   v   =   Q i   ×   Q j   will therefore be parallel to the tangent line. We have   Q i   ( {> |> } ) =   h 3 2 {>   3 2 |>   1 i   i   Q i   ( 3 1 >   1 >   2) =   h 2 >   3 2 >   1 i , and   Q j ( {> |> } ) =   h 8 {>   2 |>   2 } i   i Q j ( 3 1 >   1 >   2) =   h 3 8 >   2 >   4 i . Hence   v   =   Q i   ×   Q j   =          i   j   k  2   3 2   1  3 8   2   4          =   3 10   i   3   16   j   3   12   k . Parametric equations are:   {   =   3 1   3   10 w ,   |   = 1   3   16 w ,   }   = 2   3   12 w .  64.   (a) Let   i   ( {> |> } ) =   |   +   }   and   j ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2 . Then the required tangent line is perpendicular to both   Q i   and   Q j   at   (1 >   2 >   1)   and the vector  v   =   Q i   ×   Q j   is parallel to the tangent line. We have  Q i   ( {> |> } ) =   h 0 >   1 >   1 i   i   Q i (1 >   2 >   1) =   h 0 >   1 >   1 i , and  Q j ( {> |> } ) =   h 2 {>   2 |>   0 i   i   Q j (1 >   2 >   1) =   h 2 >   4 >   0 i . Hence  v   =   Q i   ×   Q j   =          i   j   k  0   1   1 2   4   0          =   3 4   i   + 2   j   3   2   k . So parametric equations of the desired tangent line are   {   = 1   3   4 w ,   |   = 2 + 2 w ,   }   = 1   3   2 w . (b)  65.   (a) The direction of the normal line of   I   is given by   Q I   , and that of   J   by   Q J . Assuming that  Q I   6   = 0   6   =   Q J , the two normal lines are perpendicular at   S   if   Q I   ·   Q J   = 0   at   S   C  h CI@C{> CI@C|> CI@C} i · h CJ@C{> CJ@C|> CJ@C} i   = 0   at   S   C   I { J {   +   I |   J |   +   I }   J }   = 0   at   S   . (b) Here   I   =   { 2   +   | 2   3   } 2   and   J   =   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   3   u 2 , so  Q I   ·   Q J   =   h 2 {>   2 |>   3 2 } i · h 2 {>   2 |>   2 } i   = 4 { 2   + 4 | 2   3   4 } 2   = 4 I   = 0 , since the point   ( {> |> } )   lies on the graph of  I   = 0 . To see that this is true without using calculus, note that   J   = 0   is the equation of a sphere centered at the origin and  I   = 0   is the equation of a right circular cone with vertex at the origin (which is generated by lines through the origin). At any point of intersection, the sphere’s normal line (which passes through the origin) lies on the cone, and thus is perpendicular to the cone’s normal line. So the surfaces with equations   I   = 0   and   J   = 0   are everywhere orthogonal.  66.   (a) The function   i ( {> | ) = ( {| ) 1 @ 3   is continuous on   R 2   since it is a composition of a polynomial and the cube root function, both of which are continuous. (See the text just after Example 14.2.8.)  i { (0 >   0) = lim  k < 0  i   (0 +   k>   0)   3   i   (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  ( k   ·   0) 1 @ 3   3   0  k   = 0 ,  i |   (0 >   0) = lim  k < 0  i   (0 >   0 +   k )   3   i   (0 >   0)  k   = lim  k < 0  (0   ·   k ) 1 @ 3   3   0  k   = 0 . Therefore,   i { (0 >   0)   and   i |   (0 >   0)   do exist and are equal to   0 . Now let   u   be any unit vector other than   i   and   j   (these correspond to   i {   and   i |   respectively.) Then   u   =   d   i   +   e   j   where   d   6   = 0   and   e   6   = 0 .

(b)   Notice that if we start at the origin and proceed in the direction of the   { - or   | -axis, then the graph is   fl at. But if we proceed in any other direction, then the graph is extremely steep.  67.   Let   u   =   h d> e i   and   v   =   h f> g i . Then we know that at the given point,   G u   i   =   Q i   ·   u   =   di {   +   ei |   and  G v   i   =   Q i   ·   v   =   fi {   +   gi |   . But these are just two linear equations in the two unknowns   i {   and   i |   , and since   u   and   v   are not parallel, we can solve the equations to   fi nd   Q i   =   h i { > i |   i   at the given point. In fact,  Q i   =     g G u   i   3   e G v   i dg   3   ef   >  d G v   i   3   f G u   i dg   3   ef   .  68.   Since   }   =   i   ( {> | )   is differentiable at   x 0   = ( { 0 > | 0 ) , by De fi nition 14.4.7 we have  { }   =   i { ( { 0 > | 0 )   { {   +   i |   ( { 0 > | 0 )   { |   +   % 1   { {   +   % 2   { |   where   % 1 > % 2   <   0   as   ( { {>   { | )   <   (0 >   0) . Now  { }   =   i   ( x )   3   i   ( x 0 ) ,   h { {>   { | i   =   x   3   x 0   so   ( { {>   { | )   <   (0 >   0)   is equivalent to   x   <   x 0   and  h i { ( { 0 > | 0 )   > i |   ( { 0 > | 0 ) i   =   Q i ( x 0 ) . Substituting into 14.4.7 gives   i   ( x )   3   i ( x 0 ) =   Q i   ( x 0 )   ·   ( x   3   x 0 ) +   h % 1 > % 2 i · h { {>   { | i  or   h % 1 > % 2 i ·   ( x   3   x 0 ) =   i   ( x )   3   i ( x 0 )   3 Q i   ( x 0 )   ·   ( x   3   x 0 ) , and so   i   ( x )   3   i ( x 0 )   3 Q i   ( x 0 )   ·   ( x   3   x 0 )  | x   3   x 0 |   =   h % 1 > % 2 i ·   ( x   3   x 0 )  | x   3   x 0 |   . But   x   3   x 0  | x   3   x 0 |   is a unit vector so  lim  x < x 0  h % 1 > % 2 i ·   ( x   3   x 0 )  | x   3   x 0 |   = 0   since   % 1 > % 2   <   0   as   x   <   x 0 . Hence   lim  x < x 0  i   ( x )   3   i   ( x 0 )   3 Q i   ( x 0 )   ·   ( x   3   x 0 )  | x   3   x 0 |   = 0 .  14.7   Maximum and Minimum Values 1.

Since   G A   0   and   j {{ (0 >   2)   ?   0 ,   j   has a local maximum at   (0 >   2)   by the Second Derivatives Test. (c)   G   =   j {{ (0 >   2)   j ||   (0 >   2)   3   [ j {|   (0 >   2)] 2   = (4)(9)   3   (6) 2   = 0 . In this case the Second Derivatives Test gives no information about   j   at the point   (0 >   2) .  3.   In the   fi gure, a point at approximately   (1 >   1)   is enclosed by level curves which are oval in shape and indicate that as we move away from the point in any direction the values of   i   are increasing. Hence we would expect a local minimum at or near   (1 >   1) . The level curves near   (0 >   0)   resemble hyperbolas, and as we move away from the origin, the values of   i   increase in some directions and decrease in others, so we would expect to   fi nd a saddle point there. To verify our predictions, we have   i ( {> | ) = 4 +   { 3   +   | 3   3   3 {|   i   i { ( {> | ) = 3 { 2   3   3 | ,   i |   ( {> | ) = 3 | 2   3   3 { . We have critical points where these partial derivatives are equal to   0 :   3 { 2   3   3 |   = 0 ,   3 | 2   3   3 {   = 0 . Substituting   |   =   { 2   from the  fi rst equation into the second equation gives   3( { 2 ) 2   3   3 {   = 0   i   3 { ( { 3   3   1) = 0   i   {   = 0   or   {   = 1 . Then we have two critical points,   (0 >   0)   and   (1 >   1) . The second partial derivatives are   i {{ ( {> | ) = 6 { ,   i {|   ( {> | ) =   3 3 , and   i ||   ( {> | ) = 6 | , so   G ( {> | ) =   i {{ ( {> | )   i ||   ( {> | )   3   [ i {|   ( {> | )] 2   = (6 { )(6 | )   3   ( 3 3) 2   = 36 {|   3   9 . Then   G (0 >   0) = 36(0)(0)   3   9 =   3 9 , and   G (1 >   1) = 36(1)(1)   3   9 = 27 . Since   G (0 >   0)   ?   0 ,   i   has a saddle point at   (0 >   0)   by the Second Derivatives Test. Since  G (1 >   1)   A   0   and   i {{ (1 >   1)   A   0 ,   i   has a local minimum at   (1 >   1) .  4.   In the   fi gure, points at approximately   ( 3 1 >   1)   and   ( 3 1 >   3 1)   are enclosed by oval-shaped level curves which indicate that as we move away from either point in any direction, the values of   i   are increasing. Hence we would expect local minima at or near  ( 3 1 >   ± 1) . Similarly, the point   (1 >   0)   appears to be enclosed by oval-shaped level curves which indicate that as we move away from the point in any direction the values of   i   are decreasing, so we should have a local maximum there. We also show hyperbola-shaped level curves near the points   ( 3 1 >   0) ,   (1 >   1) , and   (1 >   3 1) . The values of   i   increase along some paths leaving these points and decrease in others, so we should have a saddle point at each of these points. To con fi rm our predictions, we have   i   ( {> | ) = 3 {   3   { 3   3   2 | 2   +   | 4   i   i { ( {> | ) = 3   3   3 { 2 ,   i |   ( {> | ) =   3 4 |   + 4 | 3 .

So our critical points are   ( ± 1 >   0) ,   ( ± 1 >   ± 1) . The second partial derivatives are   i {{ ( {> | ) =   3 6 { ,   i {|   ( {> | ) = 0 , and   i ||   ( {> | ) = 12 | 2   3   4 , so  G ( {> | ) =   i {{ ( {> | )   i ||   ( {> | )   3   [ i {|   ( {> | )] 2   = ( 3 6 { )(12 | 2   3   4)   3   (0) 2   =   3 72 {| 2   + 24 { .

Thus the absolute maximum of   i   on   G   is   i    1 >   I 2      = 2 , and the absolute minimum is   0   which occurs at all points along   O 1   and   O 2 .  35.   i { ( {> | ) = 6 { 2   and   i |   ( {> | ) = 4 | 3 . And so   i {   = 0   and   i |   = 0   only occur when   {   =   |   = 0 . Hence, the only critical point inside the disk is at   {   =   |   = 0   where   i   (0 >   0) = 0 . Now on the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 ,   | 2   = 1   3   { 2   so let  j ( { ) =   i   ( {> | ) = 2 { 3   + (1   3   { 2 ) 2   =   { 4   + 2 { 3   3   2 { 2   + 1 , 3 1   $   {   $   1 .

Checking the endpoints, we get  i   ( 3 1 >   0) =   j ( 3 1) =   3 2   and   i (1 >   0) =   j (1) = 2 . Thus the absolute maximum and minimum of   i   on   G   are   i   (1 >   0) = 2   and  i   ( 3 1 >   0) =   3 2 .  Another method:   On the boundary   { 2   +   | 2   = 1   we can write   {   = cos    ,   |   = sin    , so   i   (cos   >   sin    ) = 2 cos 3      + sin 4    ,  0   $      $   2  .  36.   i { ( {> | ) = 3 { 2   3   3   and   i |   ( {> | ) =   3 3 | 2   + 12   and the critical points are   (1 >   2) ,   (1 >   3 2) ,   ( 3 1 >   2) , and   ( 3 1 >   3 2) . But only   (1 >   2)  and   ( 3 1 >   2)   are in   G   and   i   (1 >   2) = 14 ,   i   ( 3 1 >   2) = 18 . Along   O 1 :  {   =   3 2   and   i ( 3 2 > | ) =   3 2   3   | 3   + 12 | ,   3 2   $   |   $   3 , which has a maximum at   |   = 2   where   i   ( 3 2 >   2) = 14   and a minimum at  |   =   3 2   where   i   ( 3 2 >   3 2) =   3 18 .

So the absolute maximum value of   i   on   G   is   i   (2 >   2) = 18   and the minimum is  i   ( 3 2 >   3 2) =   3 18 .  37.   i   ( {> | ) =   3 ( { 2   3   1) 2   3   ( { 2 |   3   {   3   1) 2   i   i { ( {> | ) =   3 2( { 2   3   1)(2 { )   3   2( { 2 |   3   {   3   1)(2 {|   3   1)   and  i |   ( {> | ) =   3 2( { 2 |   3   {   3   1) { 2 .

There are no critical points for   {   = 0 , since   i { (0 > | ) =   3 2 , so we set   { 2 |   3   {   3   1 = 0   C   |   =   {   + 1  { 2   [ {   6   = 0 ], so   i {    {>  {   + 1  { 2    =   3 2( { 2   3   1)(2 { )   3   2    { 2   {   + 1  { 2   3   {   3   1    2 {  {   + 1  { 2   3   1    =   3 4 { ( { 2   3   1) .

In order to use the Second Derivatives Test we calculate  G ( 3 1 >   0) =   i {{ ( 3 1 >   0)   i ||   ( 3 1 >   0)   3   [ i {|   ( 3 1 >   0)] 2   = 16   A   0 ,  i {{ ( 3 1 >   0) =   3 10   ?   0 ,   G (1 >   2) = 16   A   0 , and   i {{ (1 >   2) =   3 26   ?   0 , so both   ( 3 1 >   0)   and   (1 >   2)   give local maxima.  38.   i   ( {> | ) = 3 {h |   3   { 3   3   h 3 |   is differentiable everywhere, so the requirement for critical points is that   i {   = 3 h |   3   3 { 2   = 0   (1)   and  i |   = 3 {h |   3   3 h 3 |   = 0   (2) . From   (1)   we obtain   h |   =   { 2 , and then   (2)   gives  3 { 3   3   3 { 6   = 0   i   {   = 1   or   0 , but only   {   = 1   is valid, since   {   = 0  makes   (1)   impossible. So substituting   {   = 1   into   (1)   gives   |   = 0 , and the only critical point is   (1 >   0) . The Second Derivatives Test shows that this gives a local maximum, since  G (1 >   0) =    3 6 { (3 {h |   3   9 h 3 |   )   3   (3 h |   ) 2   (1 > 0)   = 27   A   0   and   i {{ (1 >   0) = [ 3 6 { ] (1 > 0)   =   3 6   ?   0 . But   i   (1 >   0) = 1   is not an absolute maximum because, for instance,   i   ( 3 3 >   0) = 17 . This can also be seen from the graph.  39.   Let   g   be the distance from   (2 >   0 >   3 3)   to any point   ( {> |> } )   on the plane   {   +   |   +   }   = 1 , so   g   =   s ( {   3   2) 2   +   | 2   + ( }   + 3) 2  where   }   = 1   3   {   3   | , and we minimize   g 2   =   i   ( {> | ) = ( {   3   2) 2   +   | 2   + (4   3   {   3   | ) 2 . Then  i { ( {> | ) = 2( {   3   2) + 2(4   3   {   3   | )( 3 1) = 4 {   + 2 |   3   12 ,   i |   ( {> | ) = 2 |   + 2(4   3   {   3   | )( 3 1) = 2 {   + 4 |   3   8 . Solving  4 {   + 2 |   3   12 = 0   and   2 {   + 4 |   3   8 = 0   simultaneously gives   {   =   8 3   ,   |   =   2 3   , so the only critical point is      8 3   >   2 3   . An absolute minimum exists (since there is a minimum distance from the point to the plane) and it must occur at a critical point, so the shortest distance occurs for   {   =   8 3   ,   |   =   2 3   for which   g   =  t    8 3   3   2  2   +      2 3   2   +    4   3   8 3   3   2 3   2   =  t   4 3   =   2 I 3   .  40.

Then   {   +   |   +   }   = 12   and we want to minimize  { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   { 2   +   | 2   + (12   3   {   3   | ) 2   =   i   ( {> | )   for   0   ? { ,   | ?   12 .   i {   = 2 {   + 2(12   3   {   3   | )( 3 1) = 4 {   + 2 |   3   24 ,  i |   = 2 |   + 2(12   3   {   3   | )( 3 1) = 2 {   + 4 |   3   24 ,   i {{   = 4 ,   i {|   = 2 ,   i ||   = 4 . Then   i {   = 0   implies   4 {   + 2 |   = 24   or  |   = 12   3   2 {   and substituting into   i |   = 0   gives   2 {   + 4(12   3   2 { ) = 24   i   6 {   = 24   i   {   = 4   and then   |   = 4 , so the only critical point is   (4 >   4) .   G (4 >   4) = 16   3   4   A   0   and   i {{ (4 >   4) = 4   A   0 , so   i (4 >   4)   is a local minimum.   i   (4 >   4)   is also the absolute minimum [compare to the values of   i   as   {> |   <   0   or   12 ] so the numbers are   {   =   |   =   }   = 4 .  45.   Center the sphere at the origin so that its equation is   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   u 2 , and orient the inscribed rectangular box so that its edges are parallel to the coordinate axes. Any vertex of the box satis fi es   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   u 2 , so take   ( {> |> } )   to be the vertex in the   fi rst octant. Then the box has length   2 { , width   2 | , and height   2 }   = 2   s u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   with volume given by  Y   ( {> | ) = (2 { )(2 | )    2   s u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2    = 8 {|   s u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   for   0   ? { ? u ,   0   ? | ? u . Then  Y {   = (8 {| )   ·   1 2   ( u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2 ) 3 1 @ 2 ( 3 2 { ) +   s u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   ·   8 |   =  8 | ( u 2   3   2 { 2   3   | 2 )  s u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   and   Y |   =  8 { ( u 2   3   { 2   3   2 | 2 )  s u 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   . Setting   Y {   = 0   gives   |   = 0   or   2 { 2   +   | 2   =   u 2 , but   | A   0   so only the latter solution applies. Similarly,   Y |   = 0   with   { A   0  implies   { 2   + 2 | 2   =   u 2 . Substituting, we have   2 { 2   +   | 2   =   { 2   + 2 | 2   i   { 2   =   | 2   i   |   =   { . Then   { 2   + 2 | 2   =   u 2   i  3 { 2   =   u 2   i   {   =   s u 2 @ 3 =   u@ I 3 =   | . Thus the only critical point is    u@ I 3 > u@ I 3    . There must be a maximum volume and here it must occur at a critical point, so the maximum volume occurs when   {   =   |   =   u@ I 3   and the maximum volume is   Y     u I 3   >   u I 3    = 8     u I 3     u I 3    u  u 2   3     u I 3   2  3     u I 3   2  =   8 3   I 3   u 3 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

We wish to minimize surface area   = 2 {|   + 2 {}   + 2 |} , but we have  volume =   {|}   = 1000   i   }   =  1000  {|   so we minimize  i   ( {> | ) = 2 {|   + 2 {     1000  {|    + 2 |     1000  {|    = 2 {|   +  2000  |   +  2000  {   . Then   i {   = 2 |   3   2000  { 2   and   i |   = 2 {   3   2000  | 2   . Setting  i {   = 0   implies   |   =  1000  { 2   and substituting into   i |   = 0   gives   {   3   { 4  1000  = 0   i   { 3   = 1000   [since   {   6   = 0 ]   i   {   = 10 . The surface area has a minimum but no maximum and it must occur at a critical point, so the minimal surface area occurs for a box with dimensions   {   = 10 cm ,   |   = 1000 @ 10 2   = 10 cm ,   }   = 1000 @ 10 2   = 10 cm .  47.   Maximize   i   ( {> | ) =   {|  3  (6   3   {   3   2 | ) , then the maximum volume is   Y   =   {|} .  i {   =   1 3   (6 |   3   2 {|   3   | 2 ) =   1 3   | (6   3   2 {   3   2 | )   and   i |   =   1 3   {   (6   3   {   3   4 | ) . Setting   i {   = 0   and   i |   = 0   gives the critical point  (2 >   1)   which geometrically must give a maximum. Thus the volume of the largest such box is   Y   = (2)(1)    2 3     =   4 3   .  48.   Surface area   = 2( {|   +   {}   +   |} ) = 64   cm 2 , so   {|   +   {}   +   |}   = 32   or   }   =  32   3   {| {   +   |   . Maximize the volume  i   ( {> | ) =   {|   32   3   {| {   +   |   . Then   i {   =  32 | 2   3   2 {| 3   3   { 2 | 2  ( {   +   | ) 2   =   | 2   32   3   2 {|   3   { 2  ( {   +   | ) 2   and   i |   =   { 2   32   3   2 {|   3   | 2  ( {   +   | ) 2   . Setting  i {   = 0   implies   |   =  32   3   { 2  2 {   and substituting into   i |   = 0   gives   32(4 { 2 )   3   (32   3   { 2 )(4 { 2 )   3   (32   3   { 2 ) 2   = 0   or  3 { 4   + 64 { 2   3   (32) 2   = 0 . Thus   { 2   =   64 6   or   {   =   8 I 6   ,   |   =   64 @ 3 16 @  I 6   =   8 I 6   and   }   =   8 I 6   . Thus the box is a cube with edge length   8 I 6   cm.  49.   Let the dimensions be   { ,   | , and   } ; then   4 {   + 4 |   + 4 }   =   f   and the volume is  Y   =   {|}   =   {|    1 4   f   3   {   3   |    =   1 4   f{|   3   { 2 |   3   {| 2 ,   { A   0 ,   | A   0 . Then   Y {   =   1 4   f|   3   2 {|   3   | 2   and   Y |   =   1 4   f{   3   { 2   3   2 {| , so   Y {   = 0 =   Y |   when   2 {   +   |   =   1 4   f   and   {   + 2 |   =   1 4   f . Solving, we get   {   =   1 12   f ,   |   =   1 12   f   and   }   =   1 4   f   3   {   3   |   =   1 12   f . From the geometrical nature of the problem, this critical point must give an absolute maximum. Thus the box is a cube with edge length   1 12   f .  50.   The cost equals   5 {|   + 2( {}   +   |} )   and   {|}   =   Y   , so   F ( {> | ) = 5 {|   + 2 Y   ( {   +   | ) @ ( {| ) = 5 {|   + 2 Y   ( { 3 1   +   | 3 1 ) . Then  F {   = 5 |   3   2 Y { 3 2 ,   F |   = 5 {   3   2   Y | 3 2 ,   i {   = 0   implies   |   = 2   Y @ (5 { 2 ) ,   i |   = 0   implies   {   =   3  t   2 5   Y   =   | . Thus the dimensions of the aquarium which minimize the cost are   {   =   |   =   3  t   2 5   Y   units,   }   =   Y   1 @ 3    5 2   2 @ 3 .  51.   Let the dimensions be   { ,   |   and   } , then minimize   {|   + 2( {}   +   |} )   if   {|}   = 32 , 000   cm 3 . Then  i   ( {> | ) =   {|   + [64 , 000( {   +   | ) @{| ] =   {|   + 64 , 000( { 3 1   +   | 3 1 ) ,   i {   =   |   3   64 , 000 { 3 2 ,   i |   =   {   3   64 , 000 | 3 2 . And   i {   = 0   implies   |   = 64 , 000 @{ 2 ; substituting into   i |   = 0   implies   { 3   = 64 , 000   or   {   = 40   and then   |   = 40 . Now  G ( {> | ) = [(2)(64 , 000)] 2 { 3 3 | 3 3   3   1   A   0   for   (40 >   40)   and   i {{ (40 >   40)   A   0   so this is indeed a minimum. Thus the dimensions of the box are   {   =   |   = 40   cm,   }   = 20   cm.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus the absolute minimum of   k   is   k (30 >   30) = 10 , 200 , and the dimensions of the building that minimize heat loss are walls   30   m in length and height   4000 30 2   =   40 9   E   4 = 44   m. (c) From part (b), the only critical point of   k , which gives a local (and absolute) minimum, is approximately  k (25 = 54 >   20 = 43)   E   9396 .

Substituting   | 2   =   O 2   3   2 { 2   into   { 2   + 2 | 2   =   O 2   gives   { 2   + 2 O 2   3   4 { 2   =   O 2   i  3 { 2   =   O 2   i   {   =   O@ I 3   (since   { A   0 ) and then   |   =  t  O 2   3   2  O@ I 3    2   =   O@ I 3 . So the only critical point is    O@ I 3 > O@ I 3      which, from the geometrical nature of the problem, must give an absolute maximum. Thus the maximum volume is   Y    O@ I 3 > O@ I 3      =    O@ I 3    2   t  O 2   3    O@ I 3    2   3    O@ I 3    2   =   O 3 @  3   I 3     cubic units.  54.   Since   s   +   t   +   u   = 1   we can substitute   s   = 1   3   u   3   t   into   S   giving  S   =   S   ( t> u ) = 2(1   3   u   3   t ) t   + 2(1   3   u   3   t ) u   + 2 ut   = 2 t   3   2 t 2   + 2 u   3   2 u 2   3   2 ut . Since   s ,   t   and   u   represent proportions and   s   +   t   +   u   = 1 , we know   t   D   0 ,   u   D   0 , and   t   +   u   $   1 . Thus, we want to   fi nd the absolute maximum of the continuous function   S   ( t> u )   on the closed set   G   enclosed by the lines   t   = 0 ,   u   = 0 , and   t   +   u   = 1 . To   fi nd any critical points, we set the partial derivatives equal to zero:   S t   ( t> u ) = 2   3   4 t   3   2 u   = 0   and   S u   ( t> u ) = 2   3   4 u   3   2 t   = 0 . The   fi rst equation gives  u   = 1   3   2 t , and substituting into the second equation we have   2   3   4(1   3   2 t )   3   2 t   = 0   i   t   =   1 3   . Then we have one critical point,      1 3   >   1 3   , where   S      1 3   >   1 3     =   2 3   . Next we   fi nd the maximum values of   S   on the boundary of   G   which consists of three line segments. For the segment given by   u   = 0 ,   0   $   t   $   1 ,   S   ( t> u ) =   S   ( t>   0) = 2 t   3   2 t 2 ,   0   $   t   $   1 . This represents a parabola with maximum value   S      1 2   >   0    =   1 2   . On the segment   t   = 0 ,   0   $   u   $   1   we have   S   (0 > u ) = 2 u   3   2 u 2 ,   0   $   u   $   1 . This represents a parabola with maximum value   S    0 >   1 2     =   1 2   . Finally, on the segment   t   +   u   = 1 ,   0   $   t   $   1 ,  S   ( t> u ) =   S   ( t>   1   3   t ) = 2 t   3   2 t 2 ,   0   $   t   $   1   which has a maximum value of   S      1 2   >   1 2     =   1 2   . Comparing these values with the value of   S   at the critical point, we see that the absolute maximum value of   S   ( t> u )   on   G   is   2 3   .  55.   Note that here the variables are   p   and   e , and   i   ( p> e ) =   q S  l   = 1  [ | l   3   ( p{ l   +   e )] 2 . Then   i p   =   q S  l   = 1  3 2 { l [ | l   3   ( p{ l   +   e )] = 0  implies   q S  l   = 1   { l | l   3   p{ 2  l   3   e{ l     = 0   or   q S  l   = 1  { l | l   =   p   q S  l   = 1  { 2  l   +   e   q S  l   = 1  { l   and   i e   =   q S  l   = 1  3 2[ | l   3   ( p{ l   +   e )] = 0   implies  q S  l   = 1  | l   =   p   q S  l   = 1  { l   +   q S  l   = 1  e   =   p     q S  l   = 1  { l    +   qe . Thus we have the two desired equations. Now   i pp   =   q S  l   = 1  2 { 2  l   ,   i ee   =   q S  l   = 1  2 = 2 q   and   i pe   =   q S  l   = 1  2 { l .   And   i pp ( p> e )   A   0   always and  G ( p> e ) = 4 q     q S  l   = 1  { 2  l    3   4     q S  l   = 1  { l   2  = 4  %  q     q S  l   = 1  { 2  l    3     q S  l   = 1  { l   2 &  A   0   always so the solutions of these two equations do indeed minimize   q S  l   = 1  g 2  l   .  56.   Any such plane must cut out a tetrahedron in the   fi rst octant. We need to minimize the volume of the tetrahedron that passes through the point   (1 >   2 >   3) . Writing the equation of the plane as   { d   +   | e   +   } f   = 1 , the volume of the tetrahedron is given by  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus the equation of the required plane is   {  3  +   |  6  +   }  9  = 1  or   6 {   + 3 |   + 2 }   = 18 .  APPLIED PROJECT   Designing a Dumpster  Note:   The dif fi culty and results of this project vary widely with the type of container studied. In addition to the variation of basic shapes of containers, dumpsters may include additional constructed parts such as supports, lift pockets, wheels, etc. Also, a CAS or graphing utility may be needed to solve the resulting equations. Here we present a typical solution for one particular trash Dumpster.  1.   The basic shape and dimensions (in inches) of an actual trash Dumpster are as shown in the   fi gure. The front and back, as well as both sides, have an extra one-inch-wide   fl ap that is folded under and welded to the base. In addition, the side panels each fold over one inch onto the front and back pieces where they are welded. Each side has a rectangular lift pocket, with cross-section   5   by   8   inches, made of the same material. These are attached with an extra one-inch width of steel on both top and bottom where each pocket is welded to the side sheet. All four sides have a “lip” at the top; the front and back panels have an extra 5 inches of steel at the top which is folded outward in three creases to form a rectangular tube. The edge is then welded back to the main sheet. The two sides form a top lip with separate sheets of steel   5   inches wide, similarly bent into three sides and welded to the main sheets (requiring two welds each). These extend beyond the main side sheets by   1 = 5   inches at each end in order to join with the lips on the front and back panels. The container has a hinged lid, extra steel supports on the base at each corner, metal “ fi ns” serving as extra support for the side lift pockets, and wheels underneath. The volume of the container is   Y   =   1 2   (40 + 49)   ×   42   ×   72 = 134 , 568   in 3   or   77 = 875   ft 3 .  2.   First, we assume that some aspects of the construction do not change with different dimensions, so they may be considered  fi xed costs. This includes the lid (with hinges), wheels, and extra steel supports. Also, the upper “lip” we previously described  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

We can safely assume that this extra portion, including any associated welds, costs the same regardless of the container’s dimensions, so we will consider just the portion matching the measurement of the side panels in our calculations. We will further assume that the angle of the top of the container should be preserved. Then to compute the variable costs, let   {   be the width,   |   the length, and   }   the height of the front of the container.

From the nature of the function   F   (or from a graph) we can determine that   F   has an absolute minimum at   (3 = 58 >   5 = 29) , and so the minimum cost is attained for   {   E   3 = 58   ft (or   43 = 0   in),   |   E   5 = 29   ft (or   63 = 5   in), and   }   E   77 = 875 3 = 58(5 = 29)   3   3 28   (3 = 58)   E   3 = 73   ft (or   44 = 8   in).  3.   The   fi xed cost aspects of the container which we did not include in our calculations, such as the wheels and lid, don’t affect the validity of our results. Some of our other assumptions, however, may in fl uence the accuracy of our   fi ndings. We simpli fi ed the price of the steel sheets to include cuts and bends, and we simpli fi ed the price of welding to include the labor and materials. This may not be accurate for areas of the container, such as the lip and lift pockets, that require several cuts, bends, and welds in a relatively small surface area. Consequently, increasing some dimensions of the container may not increase the cost in the same manner as our computations predict. If we do not assume that the angle of the sloped top of the container must be preserved, it is likely that we could further improve our cost. Finally, our results show that the length of the container should be changed to minimize cost; this may not be possible if the two lift pockets must remain a   fi xed distance apart for handling by machinery.  4.   The minimum variable cost using our values found in Problem 2 is   F (3 = 58 >   5 = 29)   E   $96 = 95 , while the current dimensions give an estimated variable cost of   F (3 = 5 >   6 = 0)   E   $97 = 30 . If we determine that our assumptions and simpli fi cations are acceptable, our work shows that a slight savings can be gained by adjusting the dimensions of the container. However, the difference in cost is modest, and may not justify changes in the manufacturing process.  DISCOVERY PROJECT   Quadratic Approximations and Critical Points 1.

Suppose we approach the origin along the   { -axis; then we have   |   = 0   i   i   ( {>   0) =   d{ 2   which has the same sign as   d . We must now   fi nd at least one path to the origin where   i   ( {> | )   gives values with sign opposite that of   d .

Since   G ?   0 , these values have signs opposite that of   d . Thus,   i   has a saddle point at   (0 >   0) .  5.   (a) Since the partial derivatives of   i   exist at   (0 >   0)   and   (0 >   0)   is a critical point, we know   i { (0 >   0) = 0   and   i |   (0 >   0) = 0 . Then the second-degree Taylor polynomial of   i   at   (0 >   0)   can be expressed as  T ( {> | ) =   i   (0 >   0) +   i { (0 >   0)( {   3   0) +   i |   (0 >   0)( |   3   0) +   1 2   i {{ (0 >   0)( {   3   0) 2  +   i {|   (0 >   0)( {   3   0)( |   3   0) +   1 2   i ||   (0 >   0)( |   3   0) 2  =   1 2   i {{ (0 >   0) { 2   +   i {|   (0 >   0) {|   +   1 2   i ||   (0 >   0) | 2  (b)   T ( {> | ) =   1 2   i {{ (0 >   0) { 2   +   i {|   (0 >   0) {|   +   1 2   i ||   (0 >   0) | 2   fi ts the form of the polynomial function in Problem 4 with   d   =   1 2   i {{ (0 >   0) ,   e   =   i {|   (0 >   0) , and   f   =   1 2   i ||   (0 >   0) . Then we know   T   is a paraboloid, and that   T   has a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point at   (0 >   0) .

Similarly, if  G A   0   and   d ?   0   i   i {{ (0 >   0)   ?   0 ,   T   has a local maximum at   (0 >   0) , and if   G ?   0 ,   T   has a saddle point at   (0 >   0) . (c) Since   i   ( {> | )   E   T ( {> | )   near   (0 >   0) , part (b) suggests that for   G   =   i {{ (0 >   0) i ||   (0 >   0)   3   [ i {|   (0 >   0)] 2 , if   G A   0   and  i {{ (0 >   0)   A   0 ,   i   has a local minimum at   (0 >   0) . If   G A   0   and   i {{ (0 >   0)   ?   0 ,   i   has a local maximum at   (0 >   0) , and if  G ?   0 ,   i   has a saddle point at   (0 >   0) . Together with the conditions given in part (a), this is precisely the Second Derivatives Test from Section 14.7.  14.8   Lagrange Multipliers 1.   At the extreme values of   i , the level curves of   i   just touch the curve   j ( {> | ) = 8   with a common tangent line. (See Figure 1 and the accompanying discussion.) We can observe several such occurrences on the contour map, but the level curve  i   ( {> | ) =   f   with the largest value of   f   which still intersects the curve   j ( {> | ) = 8   is approximately   f   = 59 , and the smallest value of   f   corresponding to a level curve which intersects   j ( {> | ) = 8   appears to be   f   = 30 . Thus we estimate the maximum value of   i   subject to the constraint   j ( {> | ) = 8   to be about   59   and the minimum to be   30 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

These values represent possible extreme values of the function   { 2   +   |   subject to the constraint   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 . (b)   Q i   =   h 2 {>   1 i ,    Q j   =   h 2 {>   2 | i . So   2 {   = 2 {   i   either     = 1   or   {   = 0 . If      = 1 , then   |   =   1 2   and so   {   =   ±   I 3 2   (from the constraint). If   {   = 0 , then   |   =   ± 1 . Therefore   i   has possible extreme values at the points   (0 >   ± 1)   and    ±   I 3 2   >   1 2    . We calculate  i    ±   I 3 2   >   1 2    =   5 4   (the maximum value),   i   (0 >   1) = 1 , and   i   (0 >   3 1) =   3 1   (the minimum value). These are our answers from part (a).  3.   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 2 ,   j ( {> | ) =   {|   = 1 , and   Q i   =    Q j   i   h 2 {>   2 | i   =   h |> { i , so   2 {   =   | ,   2 |   =   { , and   {|   = 1 . From the last equation,   {   6   = 0   and   |   6   = 0 , so   2 {   =   |   i      = 2 {@| . Substituting, we have   2 |   = (2 {@| )   {   i  | 2   =   { 2   i   |   =   ± { . But   {|   = 1 , so   {   =   |   =   ± 1   and the possible points for the extreme values of   i   are   (1 >   1)   and  ( 3 1 >   3 1) . Here there is no maximum value, since the constraint   {|   = 1   allows   {   or   |   to become arbitrarily large, and hence  i   ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 2   can be made arbitrarily large. The minimum value is   i (1 >   1) =   i ( 3 1 >   3 1) = 2 .  4.   i   ( {> | ) = 3 {   +   | ,   j ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 2   = 10 , and   Q i   =    Q j   i   h 3 >   1 i   =   h 2 {>   2 | i , so   3 = 2 { ,   1 = 2 | , and  { 2   +   | 2   = 10 . From the   fi rst two equations we have   3 2 {   =      =   1 2 |   i   {   = 3 |   (note that the   fi rst two equations imply  {   6   = 0   and   |   6   = 0 ) and substitution into the third equation gives   9 | 2   +   | 2   = 10   i   | 2   = 1   i   |   =   ± 1 . Then   i   has possible extreme values at the points   (3 >   1)   and   ( 3 3 >   3 1) . We compute   i (3 >   1) = 10   and   i   ( 3 3 >   3 1) =   3 10 , so the maximum value of   i   on   { 2   +   | 2   = 10   is   i (3 >   1) = 10   and the minimum value is   i ( 3 3 >   3 1) =   3 10 .  5.   i   ( {> | ) =   | 2   3   { 2 ,   j ( {> | ) =   1 4   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 , and   Q i   =    Q j   i   h 3 2 {>   2 | i   =   1 2   {>   2 |  , so   3 2 {   =   1 2   { ,   2 |   = 2 | , and   1 4   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 . From the   fi rst equation we have   { (4 +    ) = 0   i   {   = 0   or      =   3 4 . If   {   = 0   then the third equation gives   |   =   ± 1 . If      =   3 4   then the second equation gives   2 |   =   3 8 |   i   |   = 0 , and substituting into the third equation, we have   {   =   ± 2 . Thus the possible extreme values of   i   occur at the points   (0 >   ± 1)   and   ( ± 2 >   0) . Evaluating   i   at these points, we see that the maximum value is   i   (0 >   ± 1) = 1   and the minimum is   i ( ± 2 >   0) =   3 4 .  6.   i   ( {> | ) =   h {|   ,   j ( {> | ) =   { 3   +   | 3   = 16 , and   Q i   =    Q j   i   h |h {|   > {h {|   i   =   3 { 2 >   3 | 2  , so   |h {|   = 3 { 2   and  {h {|   = 3 | 2 . Note that   {   = 0   C   |   = 0   which contradicts   { 3   +   | 3   = 16 , so we may assume   {   6   = 0 ,   |   6   = 0 , and then     =   |h {|   @ (3 { 2 ) =   {h {|   @ (3 | 2 )   i   { 3   =   | 3   i   {   =   | . But   { 3   +   | 3   = 16 , so   2 { 3   = 16   i   {   = 2 =   | . Here there is no minimum value, since we can choose points satisfying the constraint   { 3   +   | 3   = 16   that make   i   ( {> | ) =   h {|  arbitrarily close to   0   (but never equal to   0 ). The maximum value is   i   (2 >   2) =   h 4 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Case 3:   If exactly two of the variables are zero, then the third variable has value   ± 1   with the corresponding   i   value of   1 . Thus on   { 4   +   | 4   +   } 4   = 1 , the maximum value of   i   is   I 3   and the minimum value is   1 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Thus     =   }@ (2 | ) =   |@ (2 | )   or   | 2   =   } 2 , and so   | 2   +   } 2   = 1   implies   |   =   ±   1 I 2   ,   }   =   ±   1 I 2   .

Then   2 {   =    ,   2 |   =   3    + 2 | , and   2 }   =   3 2 }   i   }   = 0   or      =   3 1 . If   }   = 0   then   | 2   3   } 2   = 1   implies   | 2   = 1   i   |   =   ± 1 . If   |   = 1 ,   {   3   |   = 1   implies   {   = 2 , and if   |   =   3 1   we have  {   = 0 , so possible points are   (2 >   1 >   0)   and   (0 >   3 1 >   0) . If      =   3 1   then   2 |   =   3    + 2 |   implies   4 |   =   3  , but      = 2 {   so  4 |   =   3 2 {   i   {   =   3 2 |   and   {   3   |   = 1   implies   3 3 |   = 1   i   |   =   3   1 3   . But then   | 2   3   } 2   = 1   implies   } 2   =   3   8 9   , an impossibility. Thus the maximum value of   i   subject to the constraints is   i   (2 >   1 >   0) = 5   and the minimum is   i   (0 >   3 1 >   0) = 1 .  Note:   Since   {   3   |   = 1   i   {   =   |   + 1   is one of the constraints we could have solved the problem by solving  i   ( |> } ) = ( |   + 1) 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   subject to   | 2   3   } 2   = 1 .  19.   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 2   + 4 {   3   4 | . For the interior of the region, we   fi nd the critical points:   i {   = 2 {   + 4 ,   i |   = 2 |   3   4 , so the only critical point is   ( 3 2 >   2)   (which is inside the region) and   i   ( 3 2 >   2) =   3 8 . For the boundary, we use Lagrange multipliers.  j ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 2   = 9 , so   Q i   =    Q j   i   h 2 {   + 4 >   2 |   3   4 i   =   h 2 {>   2 | i . Thus   2 {   + 4 = 2 {   and   2 |   3   4 = 2 | . Adding the two equations gives   2 {   + 2 |   = 2 {   + 2 |   i   {   +   |   =    ( {   +   | )   i   ( {   +   | )(    3   1) = 0 , so  {   +   |   = 0   i   |   =   3 {   or      3   1 = 0   i      = 1 . But      = 1   leads to a contradition in   2 {   + 4 = 2 { , so   |   =   3 {   and  { 2   +   | 2   = 9   implies   2 | 2   = 9   i   |   =   ±   3 I 2   . We have   i     3 I 2   >   3   3 I 2    = 9 + 12 I 2   E   25 = 97   and  i    3   3 I 2   >   3 I 2    = 9   3   12 I 2   E 3 7 = 97 , so the maximum value of   i   on the disk   { 2   +   | 2   $   9   is   i     3 I 2   >   3   3 I 2    = 9 + 12 I 2  and the minimum is   i   ( 3 2 >   2) =   3 8 .  20.   i   ( {> | ) = 2 { 2   + 3 | 2   3   4 {   3   5   i   Q i   =   h 4 {   3   4 >   6 | i   =   h 0 >   0 i   i   {   = 1 ,   |   = 0 . Thus   (1 >   0)   is the only critical point of   i   , and it lies in the region   { 2   +   | 2   ?   16 . On the boundary,   j ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 2   = 16   i    Q j   =   h 2 {>   2 | i , so  6 |   = 2 |   i   either   |   = 0   or      = 3 . If   |   = 0 , then   {   =   ± 4 ; if      = 3 , then   4 {   3   4 = 2 {   i   {   =   3 2   and  |   =   ± 2   I 3 . Now   i   (1 >   0) =   3 7 ,   i   (4 >   0) = 11 ,   i   ( 3 4 >   0) = 43 , and   i  3 2 >   ± 2   I 3      = 47 . Thus the maximum value of  i   ( {> | )   on the disk   { 2   +   | 2   $   16   is   i    3 2 >   ± 2   I 3      = 47 , and the minimum value is   i   (1 >   0) =   3 7 .  21.   i   ( {> | ) =   h 3 {|   .   For the interior of the region, we   fi nd the critical points:   i {   =   3 |h 3 {|   ,   i |   =   3 {h 3 {|   , so the only critical point is   (0 >   0) , and   i (0 >   0) = 1 . For the boundary, we use Lagrange multipliers.   j ( {> | ) =   { 2   + 4 | 2   = 1   i   Q j   =   h 2 {>   8 | i , so setting   Q i   =    Q j   we get   3 |h 3 {|   = 2 {   and   3 {h 3 {|   = 8 | . The   fi rst of these gives  h 3 {|   =   3 2 {@| , and then the second gives   3 { ( 3 2 {@| ) = 8 |   i   { 2   = 4 | 2 . Solving this last equation with the constraint   { 2   + 4 | 2   = 1   gives   {   =   ±   1 I 2   and   |   =   ±   1 2 I 2   . Now   i    ±   1 I 2   >   ~   1 2 I 2    =   h 1 @ 4   E   1 = 284   and  i    ±   1 I 2   >   ±   1 2 I 2    =   h 3 1 @ 4   E   0 = 779 . The former are the maxima on the region and the latter are the minima.  22.   (a)   i   ( {> | ) = 2 {   + 3 | ,   j ( {> | ) =   I {   +   s |   = 5   i   Q i   =   h 2 >   3 i   =    Q j   =     -  1 2   I {  >   1 2   s |  .  . Then  2 =     2   I {   and   3 =     2   s |   so   4 I {   =      = 6 s |   i   s |   =   2 3  I { . With   I {   +   s |   = 5   we have   I {   +   2 3  I {   = 5   i I {   = 3   i   {   = 9 . Substituting into   s |   =   2 3  I {   gives   s |   = 2   or   |   = 4 . Thus the only possible extreme value subject to the constraint is   i   (9 >   4) = 30 . (The question remains whether this is indeed the maximum of   i   .)  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(c)   We can see from the level curves of   i   that the maximum occurs at the left endpoint   (0 >   25)   of the constraint curve   j . The maximum value is   i (0 >   25) = 75 . (d) Here   Q j   does not exist if   {   = 0   or   |   = 0 , so the method will not locate any associated points. Also, the method of Lagrange multipliers identi fi es points where the level curves of   i   share a common tangent line with the constraint curve   j . This normally does not occur at an endpoint, although an absolute maximum or minimum may occur there. (e) Here   i   (9 >   4)   is the absolute   minimum   of   i   subject to   j .  23.

Then  1 =    (4 { 3   3   3 { 2 )   (1)   and   0 = 2 |   (2) . We have      6   = 0   from   (1) , so   (2)   gives   |   = 0 .

But   {   = 0   contradicts   (1) , so the only possible extreme value subject to the constraint is   i   (1 >   0) = 1 . (The question remains whether this is indeed the minimum of   i   .) (b) The constraint is   | 2   +   { 4   3   { 3   = 0   C   | 2   =   { 3   3   { 4 . The left side is non-negative, so we must have   { 3   3   { 4   D   0  which is true only for   0   $   {   $   1 . Therefore the minimum possible value for   i ( {> | ) =   {   is   0   which occurs for   {   =   |   = 0 . However,    Q j (0 >   0) =      h 0   3   0 >   0 i   =   h 0 >   0 i   and   Q i   (0 >   0) =   h 1 >   0 i , so   Q i   (0 >   0)   6   =    Q j (0 >   0)   for all values of    . (c) Here   Q j (0 >   0) =   0   but the method of Lagrange multipliers requires that   Q j   6   =   0   everywhere on the constraint curve.  24.   (a) The graphs of   i ( {> | ) = 3 = 7   and   i   ( {> | ) = 350   seem to be tangent to the circle, and so   3 = 7   and   350   are the approximate minimum and maximum values of the function   i ( {> | )   subject to the constraint   ( {   3   3) 2   + ( |   3   3) 2   = 9 . (b) Let   j ( {> | ) = ( {   3   3) 2   + ( |   3   3) 2 . We calculate   i { ( {> | ) = 3 { 2   + 3 | ,  i |   ( {> | ) = 3 | 2   + 3 { ,   j { ( {> | ) = 2 {   3   6 , and   j |   ( {> | ) = 2 |   3   6 , and use a CAS to search for solutions to the equations   j ( {> | ) = ( {   3   3) 2   + ( |   3   3) 2   = 9 ,  i {   =   j { , and   i |   =   j |   . The solutions are   ( {> | ) =    3   3   3 2  I 2 >   3   3   3 2  I 2      E   (0 = 879 >   0 = 879)   and  ( {> | ) =    3 +   3 2  I 2 >   3 +   3 2  I 2      E   (5 = 121 >   5 = 121) .

Then      =   1 2   |   =   1 2   {   implies   {   =   |   and the rectangle with maximum area is a square with side length   1 4   s .  28.

Thus  ( v   3   | )( v   3   } ) = ( v   3   { )( v   3   } )   (1) , and   ( v   3   { )( v   3   } ) = ( v   3   { )( v   3   | )   (2) .   (1)   implies   {   =   |   while   (2)   implies   |   =   } , so   {   =   |   =   }   =   s@ 3   and the triangle with maximum area is equilateral.  29.   The distance from   (2 >   0 >   3 3)   to a point   ( {> |> } )   on the plane is   g   =   s ( {   3   2) 2   +   | 2   + ( }   + 3) 2 , so we seek to minimize  g 2   =   i   ( {> |> } ) = ( {   3   2) 2   +   | 2   + ( }   + 3) 2   subject to the constraint that   ( {> |> } )   lies on the plane   {   +   |   +   }   = 1 , that is, that   j ( {> |> } ) =   {   +   |   +   }   = 1 .   Then   Q i   =    Q j   i   h 2( {   3   2) >   2 |>   2( }   + 3) i   =   h > >  i , so   {   = (    + 4) @ 2 ,  |   =   @ 2 ,   }   = (    3   6) @ 2 . Substituting into the constraint equation gives      + 4 2   +     2  +      3   6 2   = 1   i   3    3   2 = 2   i     =   4 3   , so   {   =   8 3   ,   |   =   2 3   , and   }   =   3   7 3   .

The distance from   (0 >   1 >   1)   to a point   ( {> |> } )   on the plane is   g   =   s { 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2 , so we minimize  g 2   =   i   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   + ( |   3   1) 2   + ( }   3   1) 2   subject to the constraint that   ( {> |> } )   lies on the plane   {   3   2 |   + 3 }   = 6 , that is,  j ( {> |> } ) =   {   3   2 |   + 3 }   = 6 .

From the last equation we have   }   +   }   = 0   i   }   (1 +    ) = 0 , so either   }   = 0   or      =   3 1 .

So      =   3 1   and   {   3   4 =   {   i   {   = 2 ,   |   3   2 =   |   i   |   = 1 , and   { 2   +   | 2   3   } 2   = 0   i  4 + 1   3   } 2   = 0   i   }   =   ± I 5 .

Then we want to minimize   i   subject to the constraint   j   ( {> |> } ) =   | 2   3   {}   = 9 .  Q i   =    Q j   i   h 2 {>   2 |>   2 } i   =   h 3 }>   2 |>   3 { i , so   2 {   =   3 } ,   |   =   | , and   2 }   =   3 { . If   {   = 0   then the last equation implies   }   = 0 , and from the constraint   | 2   3   {}   = 9   we have   |   =   ± 3 . If   {   6   = 0 , then the   fi rst and third equations give     =   3 2 {@}   =   3 2 }@{   i   { 2   =   } 2 . From the second equation we have   |   = 0   or      = 1 . If   |   = 0   then  | 2   3   {}   = 9   i   }   =   3 9 @{   and   { 2   =   } 2   i   { 2   = 81 @{ 2   i   {   =   ± 3 .

Thus the possible points are   (0 >   ± 3 >   0) ,   (3 >   0 >   3 3) ,   ( 3 3 >   0 >   3) . We have  i   (0 >   ± 3 >   0) = 9   and   i   (3 >   0 >   3 3) =   i   ( 3 3 >   0 >   3) = 18 , so the points on the surface that are closest to the origin are   (0 >   ± 3 >   0) .  33.   i   ( {> |> } ) =   {|} ,   j ( {> |> } ) =   {   +   |   +   }   = 100   i   Q i   =   h |}> {}> {| i   =    Q j   =   h > >  i .

Minimize   i   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   subject to   j ( {> |> } ) =   {   +   |   +   }   = 12   with   { A   0 ,   | A   0 ,   } A   0 .

By comparing nearby values we can con fi rm that this gives a minimum and not a maximum. Thus the three numbers are 4, 4, and 4.  35.   If the dimensions are   2 { ,   2 | , and   2 } , then maximize   i   ( {> |> } ) = (2 { )(2 | )(2 } ) = 8 {|}   subject to  j ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   u 2   ( { A   0 ,   | A   0 ,   } A   0 ).

This gives   { 2 }   =   | 2 }   i   { 2   =   | 2   (since   }   6   = 0 ) and   {| 2   =   {} 2   i   } 2   =   | 2 , so   { 2   =   | 2   =   } 2   i   {   =   |   =   } , and substituting into the constraint equation gives   3 { 2   =   u 2   i   {   =   u@ I 3 =   |   =   } . Thus the largest volume of such a box is  i     u I 3   >   u I 3   >   u I 3    = 8     u I 3      u I 3      u I 3    =   8 3   I 3   u 3 .  36.   If the dimensions of the box are   { ,   | , and   }   then minimize   i ( {> |> } ) = 2 {|   + 2 {}   + 2 |}   subject to   j ( {> |> } ) =   {|}   = 1000  ( { A   0 ,   | A   0 ,   } A   0 ).

From   {|}   = 1000   we have   { 3   = 1000   i   {   = 10   and the dimensions of the box are   {   =   |   =   }   = 10 cm .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Then   |}   = 5 |   + 2 }   (1) ,   {}   = 5 {   + 2 }   (2) ,  {|   = 2 ( {   +   | )   (3) ,   and   {|}   =   Y   (4) . Now   (1)   3   (2)   implies   } ( |   3   { ) = 5( |   3   { ) , so   {   =   |   or      = 5 @} , but   }   can’t be   0 , so   {   =   | . T hen twice (2)   minus   fi ve times   (3)   together with   {   =   |   implies   | (2 {   3   5 | ) = 2(2 }   3   5 | )   which gives  }   =   5 2   |   [again      6   = 2 @|   or else   (3)   implies   |   = 0 ]. Hence   5 2   | 3   =   Y   and the dimensions which minimize cost are  {   =   |   =   3  t   2 5   Y   units,   }   =   Y   1 @ 3    5 2   2 @ 3   units.  41.   If the dimensions of the box are given by   { ,   | , and   } , then we need to   fi nd the maximum value of   i   ( {> |> } ) =   {|}  [ {> |> } A   0 ] subject to the constraint   O   =   s { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   or   j ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   O 2 .

Thus      =   |}  2 {   =   {}  2 |   i   { 2   =   | 2   [since   }   6   = 0 ]   i   {   =   |   and      =   |}  2 {   =   {|  2 }   i   {   =   }   [since   |   6   = 0 ]. Substituting into the constraint equation gives   { 2   +   { 2   +   { 2   =   O 2   i   { 2   =   O 2 @ 3   i   {   =   O@ I 3 =   |   =   }   and the maximum volume is    O@ I 3    3   =   O 3 @  3   I 3    .  42.   Let the dimensions of the box be   { ,   | , and   } , so its volume is   i   ( {> |> } ) =   {|} , its surface area is   2 {|   + 2 |}   + 2 {}   = 1500  and its total edge length is   4 {   + 4 |   + 4 }   = 200 . We   fi nd the extreme values of   i ( {> |> } )   subject to the constraints   j ( {> |> } ) =   {|   +   |}   +   {}   = 750   and   k ( {> |> } ) =   {   +   |   +   }   = 50 .

So   |}   =    ( |   +   } ) +      (1) ,  {}   =    ( {   +   } ) +      (2) , and   {|   =    ( {   +   | ) +      (3) . Notice that the box can’t be a cube or else   {   =   |   =   }   =   50 3  but then   {|   +   |}   +   {}   =   2500 3   6   = 750 . Assume   {   is the distinct side, that is,   {   6   =   | ,   {   6   =   } . Then   (1)   minus   (2)   implies  }   ( |   3   { ) =    ( |   3   { )   or      =   } , and   (1)   minus   (3)   implies   | ( }   3   { ) =    ( }   3   { )   or      =   | .

Thus the minimum of   i   is   i      1 3   50   3   10   I 3      ,   1 3   50 + 5   I 10      ,   1 3   50 + 5   I 10      =   1 27   87 , 500   3   2500   I 10    , and its maximum is   i    1 3   50 + 10   I 10      ,   1 3   50   3   5   I 10      ,   1 3   50   3   5   I 10      =   1 27   87 , 500 + 2500   I 10    .  Note:   If either   |   or   }   is the distinct side, then symmetry gives the same result.  43.   We need to   fi nd the extreme values of   i ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   subject to the two constraints   j ( {> |> } ) =   {   +   |   + 2 }   = 2  and   k ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   3   }   = 0 .   Q i   =   h 2 {>   2 |>   2 } i ,    Q j   =   h > >   2  i   and    Q k   =   h 2 {>   2 |>   3  i . Thus we need  2 {   =      + 2 {   (1) ,   2 |   =      + 2 |   (2) ,   2 }   = 2    3      (3) ,   {   +   |   + 2 }   = 2   (4) , and   { 2   +   | 2   3   }   = 0   (5) . From   (1)   and   (2) ,   2( {   3   | ) = 2  ( {   3   | ) , so if   {   6   =   | ,      = 1 . Putting this in   (3)   gives   2 }   = 2    3   1   or      =   }   +   1 2   , but putting     = 1   into   (1)   says      = 0 . Hence   }   +   1 2   = 0   or   }   =   3   1 2   . Then   (4)   and   (5)   become   {   +   |   3   3 = 0   and   { 2   +   | 2   +   1 2   = 0 . The last equation cannot be true, so this case gives no solution. So we must have   {   =   | . Then   (4)   and   (5)   become   2 {   + 2 }   = 2   and  2 { 2   3   }   = 0   which imply   }   = 1   3   {   and   }   = 2 { 2 . Thus   2 { 2   = 1   3   {   or   2 { 2   +   {   3   1 = (2 {   3   1)( {   + 1) = 0   so   {   =   1 2   or  {   =   3 1 . The two points to check are      1 2   >   1 2   >   1 2     and   ( 3 1 >   3 1 >   2) :   i      1 2   >   1 2   >   1 2     =   3 4   and   i   ( 3 1 >   3 1 >   2) = 6 . Thus      1 2   >   1 2   >   1 2     is the point on the ellipse nearest the origin and   ( 3 1 >   3 1 >   2)   is the one farthest from the origin.  44.   (a) After plotting   }   =   s { 2   +   | 2 , the top half of the cone, and the plane  }   = (5   3   4 {   + 3 | ) @ 8   we see the ellipse formed by the intersection of the surfaces. The ellipse can be plotted explicitly using cylindrical coordinates (see Section 15.7): The cone is given by   }   =   u , and the plane is  4 u   cos      3   3 u   sin      + 8 }   = 5 . Substituting   }   =   u   into the plane equation gives   4 u   cos      3   3 u   sin      + 8 u   = 5   i   u   =   5 4 cos      3   3 sin      + 8   . Since   }   =   u   on the ellipse, parametric equations (in cylindrical coordinates) are      =   w ,   u   =   }   =   5 4 cos   w   3   3 sin   w   + 8   ,   0   $   w   $   2  . (b) We need to   fi nd the extreme values of   i   ( {> |> } ) =   }   subject to the two constraints   j ( {> |> } ) = 4 {   3   3 |   + 8 }   = 5   and   k ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   +   | 2   3   } 2   = 0 .  Q i   =    Q j   +    Q k   i   h 0 >   0 >   1 i   =    h 4 >   3 3 >   8 i   +    h 2 {>   2 |>   3 2 } i , so we need   4    + 2 {   = 0   i   {   =   3   2     (1) ,  3 3    + 2 |   = 0   i   |   =   3   2    (2) ,   8    3   2 }   = 1   i   }   =   8  3 1 2    (3) ,   4 {   3   3 |   + 8 }   = 5   (4) , and  { 2   +   | 2   =   } 2   (5) .   [Note that      6   = 0 , else      = 0   from   (1) , but substitution into   (3)   gives a contradiction.] Substituting   (1) ,   (2) , and   (3)   into   (4)   gives   4    3   2      3   3     3   2     + 8     8  3 1 2     = 5   i      =   39  3 8 10   and into   (5)   gives    3   2     2  +     3   2    2  =     8  3 1 2    2  i   16  2   + 9  2   = (8    3   1) 2   i   39  2   3   16    + 1 = 0   i      =   1 13   or      =   1 3   . If      =   1 13   then      =   3   1 2   and   {   =   4 13   ,   |   =   3   3 13   ,   }   =   5 13   . If      =   1 3   then      =   1 2   and   {   =   3   4 3   ,   |   = 1 ,   }   =   5 3   . Thus the highest point on the ellipse is    3   4 3   >   1 >   5 3     and the lowest point is      4 13   >   3   3 13   >   5 13   .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Then the only point where   i   can have an extreme value is     f q  >  f q   ,   = = =   ,   f q    . Since we can choose values for   ( { 1 > { 2 > = = = > { q )   that make   i   as close to zero (but not equal) as we like,   i   has no minimum value. Thus the maximum value is  i     f q  >  f q   ,   = = =   ,   f q    =   q  u   f q   ·   f q   · · · · ·   f q   =   f q   . (b) From part (a),   f q   is the maximum value of   i .

So the means are equal only when   { 1   =   { 2   =   { 3   =   · · ·   =   { q   =   f q   .  48.

Notice each   NZ l   has a constant factor    170   3   1 = 6   ·   10 3 6 T 2  W   , so to simplify the computations we can equivalently maximize  i   ( T 1 > T 2 > T 3 ) =   NZ 1   +   NZ 2   +   NZ 3  170   3   1 = 6   ·   10 3 6 T 2  W  =    3 18 = 89 + 0 = 1277 T 1   3   4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 T 2 1     +    3 24 = 51 + 0 = 1358 T 2   3   4 = 69   ·   10 3 5 T 2 2    +    3 27 = 02 + 0 = 1380 T 3   3   3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 T 2 3    subject to the constraint   j ( T 1 > T 2 > T 3 ) =   T 1   +   T 2   +   T 3   =   T W   . So   fi rst we   fi nd the values of   T 1 > T 2 > T 3   where  Q i   ( T 1 > T 2 > T 3 ) =    Q j ( T 1 > T 2 > T 3 )   and   T 1   +   T 2   +   T 3   =   T W   which is equivalent to solving the system  0 = 1277   3   2(4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 ) T 1   =     0 = 1358   3   2(4 = 69   ·   10 3 5 ) T 2   =     0 = 1380   3   2(3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 ) T 3   =    T 1   +   T 2   +   T 3   =   T W  Comparing the   fi rst and third equations, we have   0 = 1277   3   2(4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 ) T 1   = 0 = 1380   3   2(3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 ) T 3   i  T 1   =   3 126 = 2255 + 0 = 9412 T 3 . From the second and third equations,  0 = 1358   3   2(4 = 69   ·   10 3 5 ) T 2   = 0 = 1380   3   2(3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 ) T 3   i   T 2   =   3 23 = 4542 + 0 = 8188 T 3 . Substituting into   T 1   +   T 2   +   T 3   =   T W   gives   ( 3 126 = 2255 + 0 = 9412 T 3 ) + ( 3 23 = 4542 + 0 = 8188 T 3 ) +   T 3   =   T W   i  2 = 76 T 3   =   T W   + 149 = 6797   i   T 3   = 0 = 3623 T W   + 54 = 23 . Then  T 1   =   3 126 = 2255 + 0 = 9412 T 3   =   3 126 = 2255 + 0 = 9412(0 = 3623 T W   + 54 = 23) = 0 = 3410 T W   3   75 = 18   and  T 2   =   3 23 = 4542 + 0 = 8188(0 = 3623 T W   + 54 = 23) = 0 = 2967 T W   + 20 = 95 . As long as we maintain   250   $   T 1   $   1110 ,  250   $   T 2   $   1110 , and   250   $   T 3   $   1225 , we can reason from the nature of the functions   NZ l   that these values give a maximum of   i   , and hence a maximum energy production, and not a minimum.  2.   From Problem 1, the value of   T 1   that maximizes energy production is   0 = 3410 T W   3   75 = 18 , but since   250   $   T 1   $   1110 , we must have   250   $   0 = 3410 T W   3   75 = 18   $   1110   i   325 = 18   $   0 = 3410 T W   $   1185 = 18   i   953 = 6   $   T W   $   3475 = 6 . Similarly,   250   $   T 2   $   1110   i   250   $   0 = 2967 T W   + 20 = 95   $   1110   i   772 = 0   $   T W   $   3670 = 5 , and  250   $   T 3   $   1225   i   250   $   0 = 3623 T W   + 54 = 23   $   1225   i   540 = 4   $   T W   $   3231 = 5 . Consolidating these results, we see that the values from Problem 1 are applicable only for   953 = 6   $   T W   $   3231 = 5 .  3.   If   T W   = 2500 , the results from Problem 1 show that the maximum energy production occurs for  T 1   = 0 = 3410 T W   3   75 = 18 = 0 = 3410(2500)   3   75 = 18 = 777 = 3  T 2   = 0 = 2967 T W   + 20 = 95 = 0 = 2967(2500) + 20 = 95 = 762 = 7  T 3   = 0 = 3623 T W   + 54 = 23 = 0 = 3623(2500) + 54 = 23 = 960 = 0  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

We compute the energy production for a nearby distribution,   T 1   = 770 ,   T 2   = 760 , and   T 3   = 970 :  NZ 1   +   NZ 2   +   NZ 3   E   8839 = 8 + 8257 = 4 + 11 , 313 = 5 = 28 , 410 = 7 . For another example, we take   T 1   = 780 ,   T 2   = 765 , and   T 3   = 955 :   NZ 1   +   NZ 2   +   NZ 3   E   8942 = 9 + 8308 = 8 + 11 , 159 = 7 = 28 , 411 = 4 . These distributions are both close to the distribution from Problem 1 and both give slightly lower energy productions, suggesting that   T 1   = 777 = 3 ,   T 2   = 762 = 7 , and  T 3   = 960 = 0   is indeed the optimal distribution.  4.   First we graph each power function in its domain if all of the  fl ow is directed to that turbine (so   T l   =   T W   ). If we use only one turbine, the graph indicates that for a water   fl ow of   1000   ft 3 @ s, Turbine 3 produces the most power, approximately   12 , 200   kW. In comparison, if we use all three turbines, the results of Problem 1 with   T W   = 1000   give   T 1   = 265 = 8 ,   T 2   = 317 = 7 , and   T 3   = 416 = 5 , resulting in a total energy production of  NZ 1   +   NZ 2   +   NZ 3   E   8397 = 4   kW. Here, using only one turbine produces signi fi cantly more energy! If the   fl ow is only  600   ft 3 @ s, we do not have the option of using all three turbines, as the domain restrictions require a minimum of   250   ft 3 @ s in each turbine. We can use just one turbine, then, and from the graph Turbine 1 produces the most energy for a water   fl ow of   600   ft 3 .  5.   If we examine the graph from Problem 4, we see that for water   fl ows above approximately   450   ft 3 @ s, Turbine 2 produces the least amount of power. Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that we should distribute the incoming   fl ow of   1500   ft 3 @ s between Turbines 1 and 3. (This can be veri fi ed by computing the power produced with the other pairs of turbines for comparison.) So now we wish to maximize   NZ 1   +   NZ 3   subject to the constraint   T 1   +   T 3   =   T W   where   T W   = 1500 . As in Problem 1, we can equivalently maximize  i   ( T 1 > T 3 ) =   NZ 1   +   NZ 3  170   3   1 = 6   ·   10 3 6 T 2  W  =    3 18 = 89 + 0 = 1277 T 1   3   4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 T 2 1     +    3 27 = 02 + 0 = 1380 T 3   3   3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 T 2 3    subject to the constraint   j ( T 1 > T 3 ) =   T 1   +   T 3   =   T W   . Then we solve   Q i   ( T 1 > T 3 ) =    Q j ( T 1 > T 3 )   i   0 = 1277   3   2    4 = 08   ·   10 3 5    T 1   =      and  0 = 1380   3   2(3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 ) T 3   =    , thus   0 = 1277   3   2(4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 ) T 1   = 0 = 1380   3   2(3 = 84   ·   10 3 5 ) T 3   i  T 1   =   3 126 = 2255 + 0 = 9412 T 3 =   Substituting into   T 1   +   T 3   =   T W   gives   3 126 = 2255 + 0 = 9412 T 3   +   T 3   = 1500   i  T 3   E   837 = 7 , and then   T 1   =   T W   3   T 3   E   1500   3   837 = 7 = 662 = 3 . So we should apportion approximately   662 = 3   ft 3 @ s to Turbine 1 and the remaining   837 = 7   ft 3 @ s to Turbine 3. The resulting energy production is  NZ 1   +   NZ 3   E   7952 = 1 + 10 , 256 = 2 = 18 , 208 = 3   kW. (We can verify that this is indeed a maximum energy production by checking nearby distributions.) In comparison, if we use all three turbines with   T W   = 1500   we get   T 1   = 436 = 3 ,   T 2   = 466 = 0 , and   T 3   = 597 = 7 , resulting in a total energy production of   NZ 1   +   NZ 2   +   NZ 3   E   16 , 538 = 7   kW. Clearly, for this   fl ow level it is bene fi cial to use only two turbines.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Note that an incoming   fl ow of   3400   ft 3 @ s is not within the domain we established in Problem 2, so we cannot simply use our previous work to give the optimal distribution. We will need to use all three turbines, due to the capacity limitations of each individual turbine, but   3400   is less than the maximum combined capacity of   3445   ft 3 @ s, so we still must decide how to distribute the   fl ows. From the graph in Problem 4, Turbine 3 produces the most power for the higher   fl ows, so it seems reasonable to use Turbine 3 at its maximum capacity of   1225   and distribute the remaining   2175   ft 3 @ s   fl ow between Turbines 1 and 2. We can again use the technique of Lagrange multipliers to determine the optimal distribution. Following the procedure we used in Problem 5, we wish to maximize   NZ 1   +   NZ 2   subject to the constraint   T 1   +   T 2   =   T W   where   T W   = 2175 . We can equivalently maximize  i   ( T 1 > T 2 ) =   NZ 1   +   NZ 2  170   3   1 = 6   ·   10 3 6 T 2  W  =    3 18 = 89 + 0 = 1277 T 1   3   4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 T 2 1     +    3 24 = 51 + 0 = 1358 T 2   3   4 = 69   ·   10 3 5 T 2 2    subject to the constraint   j ( T 1 > T 2 ) =   T 1   +   T 2   =   T W   . Then we solve   Q i   ( T 1 > T 2 ) =    Q j ( T 1 > T 2 )   i  0 = 1277   3   2(4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 ) T 1   =      and   0 = 1358   3   2(4 = 69   ·   10 3 5 ) T 2   =      , thus  0 = 1277   3   2(4 = 08   ·   10 3 5 ) T 1   = 0 = 1358   3   2  4 = 69   ·   10 3 5  T 2   i   T 1   =   3 99 = 2647 + 1 = 1495 T 2 . Substituting into   T 1   +   T 2   =   T W   gives   3 99 = 2647 + 1 = 1495 T 2   +   T 2   = 2175   i   T 2   E   1058 = 0 , and then   T 1   E   1117 = 0 . This value for  T 1   is larger than the allowable maximum   fl ow to Turbine 1, but the result indicates that the   fl ow to Turbine 1 should be maximized. Thus we should recommend that the company apportion the maximum allowable   fl ows to Turbines 1 and 3,   1110  and   1225   ft 3 @ s, and the remaining   1065   ft 3 @ s to Turbine 2. Checking nearby distributions within the domain veri fi es that we have indeed found the optimal distribution.  14   Review 1.   (a) A function   i   of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair   ( {> | )   of real numbers in its domain a unique real number denoted by   i   ( {> | ) . (b) One way to visualize a function of two variables is by graphing it, resulting in the surface   }   =   i   ( {> | ) . Another method for visualizing a function of two variables is a contour map. The contour map consists of level curves of the function which are horizontal traces of the graph of the function projected onto the   {| -plane. Also, we can use an arrow diagram such as Figure 1 in Section 14.1.  2.   A function   i   of three variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple   ( {> |> } )   in its domain a unique real number  i   ( {> |> } ) . We can visualize a function of three variables by examining its level surfaces   i ( {> |> } ) =   n , where   n   is a constant.  3.   lim  ( {>| ) < ( d>e )   i   ( {> | ) =   O   means the values of   i   ( {> | )   approach the number   O   as the point   ( {> | )   approaches the point   ( d> e )  along any path that is within the domain of   i   . We can show that a limit at a point does not exist by   fi nding two different paths approaching the point along which   i ( {> | )   has different limits.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(a) By Theorem 14.7.2, if   i   has a local maximum at   ( d> e )   and the   fi rst-order partial derivatives of   i   exist there, then  i { ( d> e ) = 0   and   i |   ( d> e ) = 0 . (b) A critical point of   i   is a point   ( d> e )   such that   i { ( d> e ) = 0   and   i |   ( d> e ) = 0   or one of these partial derivatives does not exist.  17.

True.   i |   ( d> e ) = lim  k < 0  i   ( d> e   +   k )   3   i   ( d> e )  k   from Equation 14.3.3. Let   k   =   |   3   e . As   k   <   0 ,   |   <   e .

Then   I {   =   |   +   } ,   I |   =   {   +   } ,   I }   =   {   +   | , so  I { (1 >   1 >   1) =   I |   (1 >   1 >   1) =   I }   (1 >   1 >   1) = 2 . From Equation 14.6.19, an equation of the tangent plane is  2( {   3   1) + 2( |   3   1) + 2( }   3   1) = 0   or, equivalently,   {   +   |   +   }   = 3 . (b) From Equations 14.6.20, symmetric equations for the normal line are   {   3   1 2   =   |   3   1 2   =   }   3   1 2   or, equivalently,  {   =   |   =   } .  29.   (a) Let   I   ( {> |> } ) =   {   + 2 |   + 3 }   3   sin( {|} ) . Then   I {   = 1   3   |}   cos( {|} ) ,   I |   = 2   3   {}   cos( {|} ) ,   I }   = 3   3   {|   cos( {|} ) , so   I { (2 >   3 1 >   0) = 1 ,   I |   (2 >   3 1 >   0) = 2 ,   I }   (2 >   3 1 >   0) = 5 . From Equation 14.6.19, an equation of the tangent plane is  1( {   3   2) + 2( |   + 1) + 5( }   3   0) = 0   or   {   + 2 |   + 5 }   = 0 . (b) From Equations 14.6.20, symmetric equations for the normal line are   {   3   2 1   =   |   + 1 2   =   }  5   or   {   3   2 =   |   + 1 2   =   }  5   . Parametric equations are   {   = 2 +   w ,   |   =   3 1 + 2 w ,   }   = 5 w .  30.   Let   i ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   | 4 . Then   i { ( {> | ) = 2 {   and   i |   ( {> | ) = 4 | 3 , so   i { (1 >   1) = 2 ,  i |   (1 >   1) = 4   and an equation of the tangent plane is   }   3   2 = 2( {   3   1) + 4( |   3   1)  or   2 {   + 4 |   3   }   = 4 . A normal vector to the tangent plane is   h 2 >   4 >   3 1 i   so the normal line is given by   {   3   1 2   =   |   3   1 4   =   }   3   2  3 1   or   {   = 1 + 2 w ,   |   = 1 + 4 w ,  }   = 2   3   w .  31.   The hyperboloid is a level surface of the function   I   ( {> |> } ) =   { 2   + 4 | 2   3   } 2 , so a normal vector to the surface at   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )  is   Q I   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) =   h 2 { 0 >   8 | 0 >   3 2 } 0 i . A normal vector for the plane   2 {   + 2 |   +   }   = 5   is   h 2 >   2 >   1 i . For the planes to be parallel, we need the normal vectors to be parallel, so   h 2 { 0 >   8 | 0 >   3 2 } 0 i   =   n   h 2 >   2 >   1 i , or   { 0   =   n   ,   | 0   =   1 4   n , and   } 0   =   3   1 2   n . But   { 2 0   + 4 | 2 0   3   } 2 0   = 4   i   n 2   +   1 4   n 2   3   1 4   n 2   = 4   i   n 2   = 4   i   n   =   ± 2 . So there are two such points:   2 >   1 2   >   3 1    and    3 2 >   3   1 2   >   1  .  32.   x   = ln(1 +   vh 2 w )   i   gx   =   Cx Cv  gv   +   Cx Cw  gw   =   h 2 w  1 +   vh 2 w   gv   +   2 vh 2 w  1 +   vh 2 w   gw  33.   i   ( {> |> } ) =   { 3 s | 2   +   } 2   i   i { ( {> |> } ) = 3 { 2 s | 2   +   } 2 ,   i |   ( {> |> } ) =   |{ 3  s | 2   +   } 2   ,   i }   ( {> |> } ) =   }{ 3  s | 2   +   } 2   , so   i   (2 >   3 >   4) = 8(5) = 40 ,   i { (2 >   3 >   4) = 3(4)   I 25 = 60 ,   i |   (2 >   3 >   4) =   3(8)  I 25   =   24 5   , and   i }   (2 >   3 >   4) =   4(8)  I 25   =   32 5   .

(a) By Theorem 14.6.15, the maximum value of the directional derivative occurs when   u   has the same direction as the gradient vector. (b) It is a minimum when   u   is in the direction opposite to that of the gradient vector (that is,   u   is in the direction of   3Q i   ), since   G u   i   =   | Q i   |   cos      (see the proof of Theorem 14.6.15) has a minimum when      =    . (c) The directional derivative is   0   when   u   is perpendicular to the gradient vector, since then   G u   i   =   Q i   ·   u   = 0 .

First we draw a line passing through Homestead and the eye of the hurricane. We can approximate the directional derivative at Homestead in the direction of the eye of the hurricane by the average rate of change of wind speed between the points where this line intersects the contour lines closest to Homestead. In the direction of the eye of the hurricane, the wind speed changes from   45   to   50   knots. We estimate the distance between these two points to be approximately   8   miles, so the rate of change of wind speed in the direction given is approximately   50   3   45 8   =   5 8   = 0 = 625   knot @ mi.  50.

The vector   v   =   Q i   ×   Q j   is therefore parallel to the line.   Q i ( {> |> } ) =   h 3 4 {>   2 |>   1 i   i Q i   ( 3 2 >   2 >   4) =   h 8 >   4 >   1 i ,   Q j ( {> |> } ) =   h 0 >   0 >   1 i   i   Q j h 3 2 >   2 >   4 i   =   h 0 >   0 >   1 i .

Thus the only critical point is   ( 3 4 >   1)   and   i {{ ( 3 4 >   1)   A   0 ,  G ( 3 4 >   1) = 3   A   0 , so   i   ( 3 4 >   1) =   3 11   is a local minimum.  52.   i   ( {> | ) =   { 3   3   6 {|   + 8 | 3   i   i {   = 3 { 2   3   6 | ,   i |   =   3 6 {   + 24 | 2 ,   i {{   = 6 { ,  i ||   = 48 | ,   i {|   =   3 6 .

Then   i {   = 0   implies  | (3   3   2 {   3   | ) = 0   so   |   = 0   or   |   = 3   3   2 { . Substituting into   i |   = 0   implies  { (3   3   { ) = 0   or   3 { ( 3 1 +   { ) = 0 . Hence the critical points are   (0 >   0) ,   (3 >   0) ,  (0 >   3)   and   (1 >   1) .   G (0 >   0) =   G (3 >   0) =   G (0 >   3) =   3 9   ?   0   so   (0 >   0) ,   (3 >   0) , and  (0 >   3)   are saddle points.   G (1 >   1) = 3   A   0   and   i {{ (1 >   1) =   3 2   ?   0 , so  i   (1 >   1) = 1   is a local maximum.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Substituting  |   = 4   3   2 {   into   i |   = 0   implies   {   = 0 ,   {   = 2   or   {   = 1 , but   {   = 0   isn’t inside   G , and when   {   = 2 ,   |   = 0   but   (2 >   0)   isn’t inside   G . Thus the only critical point inside  G   is   (1 >   2)   and   i   (1 >   2) = 4 . Secondly we consider the boundary of   G . On   O 1 :   i   ( {>   0) = 0   and so   i   = 0   on   O 1 . On   O 2 :   {   =   3 |   + 6   and  i   ( 3 |   + 6 > | ) =   | 2 (6   3   | )( 3 2) =   3 2(6 | 2   3   | 3 )   which has critical points at   |   = 0   and   |   = 4 . Then   i   (6 >   0) = 0   while   i   (2 >   4) =   3 64 . On   O 3 :   i   (0 > | ) = 0 , so   i   = 0   on   O 3 . Thus on   G   the absolute maximum of   i   is   i (1 >   2) = 4   while the absolute minimum is   i   (2 >   4) =   3 64 .  56.   Inside   G :   i {   = 2 {h 3 { 2 3 | 2  (1   3   { 2   3   2 | 2 ) = 0   implies   {   = 0   or   { 2   + 2 | 2   = 1 . Then if   {   = 0 ,  i |   = 2 |h 3 { 2 3 | 2  (2   3   { 2   3   2 | 2 ) = 0   implies   |   = 0   or   2   3   2 | 2   = 0   giving the critical points   (0 >   0) ,   (0 >   ± 1) . If  { 2   + 2 | 2   = 1 , then   i |   = 0   implies   |   = 0   giving the critical points   ( ± 1 >   0) . Now   i   (0 >   0) = 0 ,   i   ( ± 1 >   0) =   h 3 1   and  i   (0 >   ± 1) = 2 h 3 1 . On the boundary of   G :   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 , so   i   ( {> | ) =   h 3 4 (4 +   | 2 )   and   i   is smallest when   |   = 0   and largest when   | 2   = 4 . But   i   ( ± 2 >   0) = 4 h 3 4 ,   i   (0 >   ± 2) = 8 h 3 4 . Thus on   G   the absolute maximum of   i   is   i   (0 >   ± 1) = 2 h 3 1   and the absolute minimum is   i   (0 >   0) = 0 .  57.   i   ( {> | ) =   { 3   3   3 {   +   | 4   3   2 | 2  From the graphs, it appears that   i   has a local maximum   i   ( 3 1 >   0)   E   2 , local minima   i (1 >   ± 1)   E 3 3 , and saddle points at  ( 3 1 >   ± 1)   and   (1 >   0) .

From the   fi rst graph, we see that this is true when   |   E 3 1 = 542 ,   3 0 = 717 , or   2 = 260 . (Alternatively, we could have found the solutions to   i {   =   i |   = 0   using a CAS.) So to three decimal places, the critical points are   (3 = 085 >   3 1 = 542) ,   (1 = 434 >   3 0 = 717) , and   ( 3 4 = 519 >   2 = 260) .

Alternate solution:   j ( {> |> } ) =   {| 2 } 3   = 2   implies   | 2   =   2  {} 3   , so minimize   i   ( {> } ) =   { 2   +   2  {} 3   +   } 2 .

But if   {   + 2 |   + 2 } ?   108 , there exists    A   0   such that   {   + 2 |   + 2 }   = 108   3      and as above  6 |   = 108   3      implies   |   = (108   3    ) @ 6 =   } ,   {   = (108   3    ) @ 3   with   Y   = (108   3    ) 3 @ (6 2   ·   3)   ?   (108) 3 @ (6 2   ·   3) = 11 , 664 . Hence we have shown that the maximum of   Y   subject to   j ( {> |> } )   $   108   is the maximum of   Y   subject to   j ( {> |> } ) = 108  (an intuitively obvious fact).  65.   The area of the triangle is   1 2   fd   sin      and the area of the rectangle is   ef . Thus, the area of the whole object is   i   ( d> e> f ) =   1 2   fd   sin      +   ef . The perimeter of the object is   j ( d> e> f ) = 2 d   + 2 e   +   f   =   S   . To simplify   sin      in terms of   d ,   e , and   f   notice that   d 2   sin 2      +      1 2   f  2   =   d 2   i   sin      =   1 2 d  I 4 d 2   3   f 2 . Thus   i   ( d> e> f ) =   f  4  I 4 d 2   3   f 2   +   ef . (Instead of using    , we could just have used the Pythagorean Theorem.) As a result, by Lagrange’s method, we must   fi nd   d ,   e ,   f , and      by solving   Q i   =    Q j   which gives the following equations:   fd (4 d 2   3   f 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   = 2    (1) ,   f   = 2    (2) ,   1 4   (4 d 2   3   f 2 ) 1 @ 2   3   1 4   f 2 (4 d 2   3   f 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   +   e   =     (3) , and   2 d   + 2 e   +   f   =   S   (4) . From   (2) ,      =   1 2   f   and so   (1)   produces   fd (4 d 2   3   f 2 ) 3 1 @ 2   =   f   i   (4 d 2   3   f 2 ) 1 @ 2   =   d   i  4 d 2   3   f 2   =   d 2   i   f   =   I 3   d   (5) . Similarly, since    4 d 2   3   f 2  1 @ 2   =   d   and      =   1 2   f ,   (3)   gives   d  4   3   f 2  4 d   +   e   =   f  2   , so from  (5) ,   d  4   3   3 d  4   +   e   =  I 3   d  2   i   3   d  2   3 I 3   d  2   =   3 e   i   e   =   d  2   1 +   I 3      (6) . Substituting   (5)   and   (6)   into   (4)   we get:  2 d   +   d  1 +   I 3      +   I 3   d   =   S   i   3 d   + 2   I 3   d   =   S   i   d   =   S  3 + 2   I 3  =  2   I 3   3   3 3   S   and thus  e   =   2   I 3   3   3  1 +   I 3     6   S   =  3   3  I 3 6   S   and   f   =    2   3  I 3    S   .  66.

Here  i { ( {> | ) = [2 {   3   2( O   3   { )][ | 2   + ( Z   3   | ) 2 ] = 0   i   4 {   3   2 O   = 0   or   {   =   1 2   O , and  i |   ( {> | ) = [ { 2   + ( O   3   { ) 2 ][2 |   3   2( Z   3   | )] = 0   i   4 |   3   2 Z   = 0   or   |   =   Z@ 2 . Also  i {{   = 4[ | 2   + ( Z   3   | ) 2 ] ,   i ||   = 4[ { 2   + ( O   3   { ) 2 ] , and   i {|   = (4 {   3   2 O )(4 |   3   2 Z   ) . Then  G   = 16[ | 2   + ( Z   3   | ) 2 ][ { 2   + ( O   3   { ) 2 ]   3   (4 {   3   2 O ) 2 (4 |   3   2 Z   ) 2 . Thus when   {   =   1 2   O   and   |   =   1 2   Z   ,   G A   0   and  i {{   = 2 Z   2   A   0 . Thus a minimum of   i   occurs at      1 2   O>   1 2   Z      and this minimum value is   i      1 2   O>   1 2   Z      =   1 4   O 2 Z   2 . There are no other critical points, so the maximum must occur on the boundary. Now along the width of the rectangle let  j ( | ) =   i   (0 > | ) =   i   ( O> | ) =   O 2 [ | 2   + ( Z   3   | ) 2 ] ,   0   $   |   $   Z   . Then   j 0 ( | ) =   O 2 [2 |   3   2( Z   3   | )] = 0   C   |   =   1 2   Z   . And   j    1 2     =   1 2   O 2 Z   2 . Checking the endpoints, we get   j (0) =   j ( Z   ) =   O 2 Z   2 . Along the length of the rectangle let  k ( { ) =   i ( {>   0) =   i ( {> Z   ) =   Z   2 [ { 2   + ( O   3   { ) 2 ] ,   0   $   {   $   O . By symmetry   k 0 ( { ) = 0   C   {   =   1 2   O   and  k    1 2   O    =   1 2   O 2 Z   2 . At the endpoints we have   k (0) =   k ( O ) =   O 2 Z   2 . Therefore   O 2 Z   2   is the maximum value of   i . This maximum value of   i   occurs when the “cutting” lines correspond to sides of the rectangle.  2.   (a) The level curves of the function   F ( {> | ) =   h 3 ( { 2 +2 | 2 ) @ 10 4  are the curves   h 3 ( { 2 +2 | 2 ) @ 10 4  =   n   ( n   is a positive constant). This equation is equivalent to   { 2   + 2 | 2   =   N   i   { 2   I N   2   +   | 2   s N@ 2   2   = 1 , where  N   =   3 10 4   ln   n , a family of ellipses. We sketch level curves for   N   = 1 ,  2 ,   3 , and   4 . If the shark always swims in the direction of maximum increase of blood concentration, its direction at any point would coincide with the gradient vector. Then we know the shark’s path is perpendicular to the level curves it intersects. We sketch one example of such a path. (b)   Q F   =   3   2 10 4   h 3 ( { 2 +2 | 2 ) @ 10 4  ( {   i   + 2 |   j ) . And   Q F   points in the direction of most rapid increase in concentration; that is,  Q F   is tangent to the most rapid increase curve.

(a) The area of a trapezoid is   1 2   k ( e 1   +   e 2 ) , where   k   is the height (the distance between the two parallel sides) and   e 1 ,   e 2   are the lengths of the bases (the parallel sides). From the   fi gure in the text, we see that   k   =   {   sin    ,   e 1   =   z   3   2 { , and  e 2   =   z   3   2 {   + 2 {   cos    . Therefore the cross-sectional area of the rain gutter is  D ( {>  ) =   1 2   {   sin      [( z   3   2 { ) + ( z   3   2 {   + 2 {   cos    )] = ( {   sin    )( z   3   2 {   +   {   cos    ) =   z{   sin      3   2 { 2   sin      +   { 2   sin      cos    ,   0   ? {   $   1 2   z ,   0   ?    $     2  We look for the critical points of   D :   CD@C{   =   z   sin      3   4 {   sin      + 2 {   sin      cos      and  CD@C   =   z{   cos      3   2 { 2   cos      +   { 2 (cos 2      3   sin 2    ) , so   CD@C{   = 0   C   sin      ( z   3   4 {   + 2 {   cos    ) = 0   C  cos      =  4 {   3   z  2 {   = 2   3   z  2 {   ( 0   ?    $     2   i   sin    A   0 ).

As in Example 14.7.6, we can argue from the physical nature of this problem that we have found a local maximum of   D . Now checking the boundary of   D , let  j (  ) =   D ( z@ 2 >  ) =   1 2   z 2   sin      3   1 2   z 2   sin      +   1 4   z 2   sin      cos      =   1 8   z 2   sin 2  ,   0   ?    $     2   . Clearly   j   is maximized when  sin 2    = 1   in which case   D   =   1 8   z 2 . Also along the line      =     2   , let   k ( { ) =   D  {>     2     =   z{   3   2 { 2 ,   0   ? { ?   1 2   z   i  k 0 ( { ) =   z   3   4 {   = 0   C   {   =   1 4   z , and   k    1 4   z    =   z    1 4   z    3   2    1 4   z  2   =   1 8   z 2 . Since   1 8   z 2   ?   I 3 12   z 2 , we conclude that the local maximum found earlier was an absolute maximum. (b) If the metal were bent into a semi-circular gutter of radius   u , we would have   z   =   u   and   D   =   1 2   u 2   =   1 2        z    2  =   z 2  2    . Since   z 2  2   A  I 3   z 2  12   , it   would   be better to bend the metal into a gutter with a semicircular cross-section.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Now for each   u ,  | ( {   +   |   +   } ) u   |   =    | {   +   |   +   } | 2  u@ 2   =    ( {   +   |   +   } ) 2  u@ 2   $    4( { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 )  u@ 2   = 2 u   ( { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 ) u@ 2  for   ( {> |> } )   6   = (0 >   0 >   0) . Thus  | i   ( {> |> } )   3   0 |   =        ( {   +   |   +   } ) u  { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2        =   | ( {   +   |   +   } ) u   |  { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   $   2 u   ( { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 ) u@ 2  { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   = 2 u   ( { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 ) ( u@ 2) 3 1  for   ( {> |> } )   6   = (0 >   0 >   0) . Thus if   ( u@ 2)   3   1   A   0 , that is   u A   2 , then   2 u   ( { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 ) ( u@ 2) 3 1   <   0   as   ( {> |> } )   <   (0 >   0 >   0)  and so   lim  ( {>|>} ) < (0 > 0 > 0)   ( {   +   |   +   } ) u   @ ( { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2 ) = 0 . Hence for   u A   2 ,   i   is continuous on   R 3 . Now if   u   $   2 , then as  ( {> |> } )   <   (0 >   0 >   0)   along the   { -axis,   i ( {>   0 >   0) =   { u @{ 2   =   { u 3 2   for   {   6   = 0 . So when   u   = 2 ,   i   ( {> |> } )   <   1   6   = 0   as  ( {> |> } )   <   (0 >   0 >   0)   along the   { -axis and when   u ?   2   the limit of   i   ( {> |> } )   as   ( {> |> } )   <   (0 >   0 >   0)   along the   { -axis doesn’t exist and thus can’t be zero. Hence for   u   $   2   i   isn’t continuous at   (0 >   0 >   0)   and thus is not continuous on   R 3 .  5.   Let   j ( {> | ) =   {i     | {    . Then   j { ( {> | ) =   i     | {    +   {i 0     | {    3   | { 2    =   i     | {    3   | {  i   0     | {    and  j |   ( {> | ) =   {i   0     | {      1  {    =   i 0     | {    . Thus the tangent plane at   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   on the surface has equation  }   3   { 0 i     | 0  { 0    =    i     | 0  { 0    3   | 0 { 3 1 0   i 0     | 0  { 0    ( {   3   { 0 ) +   i   0     | 0  { 0    ( |   3   | 0 )   i    i     | 0  { 0    3   | 0 { 3 1 0   i   0     | 0  { 0    {   +    i   0     | 0  { 0    |   3   }   = 0 . But any plane whose equation is of the form   d{   +   e|   +   f}   = 0  passes through the origin. Thus the origin is the common point of intersection.  6.   (a) At   ( { 1 > | 1 >   0)   the equations of the tangent planes to   }   =   i   ( {> | )   and   }   =   j ( {> | )   are  S 1 :   }   3   i ( { 1 > | 1 ) =   i { ( { 1 > | 1 )( {   3   { 1 ) +   i |   ( { 1 > | 1 )( |   3   | 1 )  and   S 2 :   }   3   j   ( { 1 > | 1 ) =   j { ( { 1 > | 1 )( {   3   { 1 ) +   j |   ( { 1 > | 1 )( |   3   | 1 )  respectively.   S 1   intersects the   {| -plane in the line given by   i { ( { 1 > | 1 )( {   3   { 1 ) +   i |   ( { 1 > | 1 )( |   3   | 1 ) =   3 i   ( { 1 > | 1 ) ,  }   = 0 ; and   S 2   intersects the   {| -plane in the line given by   j { ( { 1 > | 1 )( {   3   { 1 ) +   j |   ( { 1 > | 1 )( |   3   | 1 ) =   3 j ( { 1 > | 1 ) ,  }   = 0 . The point   ( { 2 > | 2 >   0)   is the point of intersection of these two lines, since   ( { 2 > | 2 >   0)   is the point where the line of intersection of the two tangent planes intersects the   {| -plane. Thus   ( { 2 > | 2 )   is the solution of the simultaneous equations  i { ( { 1 > | 1 )( { 2   3   { 1 ) +   i |   ( { 1 > | 1 )( | 2   3   | 1 ) =   3 i   ( { 1 > | 1 )  and   j { ( { 1 > | 1 )( { 2   3   { 1 ) +   j |   ( { 1 > | 1 )( | 2   3   | 1 ) =   3 j ( { 1 > | 1 )  For simplicity, rewrite   i { ( { 1 > | 1 )   as   i {   and similarly for   i |   ,   j { ,   j |   ,   i   and   j   and solve the equations  ( i { )( { 2   3   { 1 ) + ( i |   )( | 2   3   | 1 ) =   3 i   and   ( j { )( { 2   3   { 1 ) + ( j |   )( | 2   3   | 1 ) =   3 j   simultaneously for   ( { 2   3   { 1 )   and  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Hence   { 2   =   { 1   3   ij |   3   i |   j i { j |   3   j { i |  . (b) Let   i   ( {> | ) =   { {   +   | |   3   1000   and   j ( {> | ) =   { |   +   | {   3   100 . Then we wish to solve the system of equations   i   ( {> | ) = 0 ,  j ( {> | ) = 0 . Recall   g g{   [ { { ] =   { { (1 + ln   { )   (differentiate logarithmically), so   i { ( {> | ) =   { { (1 + ln   { ) ,  i |   ( {> | ) =   | |   (1 + ln   | ) ,   j { ( {> | ) =   |{ | 3 1   +   | {   ln   | , and   j |   ( {> | ) =   { |   ln   {   +   {| { 3 1 . Looking at the graph, we estimate the   fi rst point of intersection of the curves, and thus the solution to the system, to be approximately   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5) . Then following the method of part (a),   { 1   = 2 = 5 ,   | 1   = 4 = 5   and  { 2   = 2 = 5   3   i   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j |   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   3   i |   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)  i { (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j |   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   3   i |   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j { (2 = 5 >   4 = 5   E   2 = 447674117  | 2   = 4 = 5   3   i { (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   3   i   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j { (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)  i { (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j |   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   3   i |   (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   j { (2 = 5 >   4 = 5)   E   4 = 555657467  Continuing this procedure, we arrive at the following values. (If you use a CAS, you may need to increase its computational precision.)  { 1   = 2 = 5   | 1   = 4 = 5  { 2   = 2 = 447674117   | 2   = 4 = 555657467  { 3   = 2 = 449614877   | 3   = 4 = 551969333  { 4   = 2 = 449624628   | 4   = 4 = 551951420  { 5   = 2 = 449624628   | 5   = 4 = 551951420  Thus, to six decimal places, the point of intersection is   (2 = 449625 >   4 = 551951) . The second point of intersection can be found similarly, or, by symmetry it is approximately   (4 = 551951 >   2 = 449625) .  7.   Since we are minimizing the area of the ellipse, and the circle lies above the   { -axis, the ellipse will intersect the circle for only one value of   | . This   | -value must satisfy both the equation of the circle and the equation of the ellipse. Now  { 2  d 2   +   | 2  e 2   = 1   i   { 2   =   d 2  e 2   e 2   3   | 2  .

In order for there to be only one solution to this quadratic equation, the discriminant must be   0 , so   4   3   4 d 2   e 2   3   d 2  e 2   = 0   i  e 2   3   d 2 e 2   +   d 4   = 0 . The area of the ellipse is   D ( d> e ) =   de , and we minimize this function subject to the constraint  j ( d> e ) =   e 2   3   d 2 e 2   +   d 4   = 0 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Substitute this into   (3)   to get   e   =   3 I 2   i   d   =  t   3 2   .  8.   The tangent plane to the surface   {| 2 } 2   = 1 , at the point   ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 )   is  | 2 0   } 2 0   ( {   3   { 0 ) + 2 { 0 | 0 } 2 0   ( |   3   | 0 ) + 2 { 0 | 2 0   } 0 ( }   3   } 0 ) = 0   i    | 2 0   } 2 0   {   +    2 { 0 | 0 } 2 0   |   +    2 { 0 | 2 0   } 0   }   = 5 { 0 | 2 0   } 2 0   = 5 . Using the formula derived in Example 12.5.8, we   fi nd that the distance from   (0 >   0 >   0)   to this tangent plane is  G ( { 0 > | 0 > } 0 ) =    5 { 0 | 2 0   } 2 0    s ( | 2 0   } 2 0   ) 2   + (2 { 0 | 0 } 2 0   ) 2   + (2 { 0 | 2 0   } 0 ) 2   . When   G   is a maximum,   G 2   is a maximum and   Q G 2   =   0 . Dropping the subscripts, let  i   ( {> |> } ) =   G 2   =   25( {|} ) 2  | 2 } 2   + 4 { 2 } 2   + 4 { 2 | 2   . Now use the fact that for points on the surface   {| 2 } 2   = 1   we have   } 2   =   1  {| 2   , to get   i ( {> | ) =   G 2   =   25 {  1  {   +  4 { | 2   + 4 { 2 | 2  =   25 { 2 | 2  | 2   + 4 { 2   + 4 { 3 | 4   .

Also   i |   = 0   i  50 { 2 | ( | 2   + 4 { 2   + 4 { 3 | 4 )   3   (2 |   + 16 { 3 | 3 )25 { 2 | 2  ( | 2   + 4 { 2   + 4 { 3 | 4 ) 2   = 0   i   4 { 4 |   3   4 { 5 | 5   = 0   i   { 4 | (1   3   {| 4 ) = 0   i  1 =   {| 4 .

Therefore the tangent planes that are farthest from the origin are at the four points   (2 3 2 @ 5 >   ± 2 1 @ 10 >   ± 2 1 @ 10 ) . These points all give a maximum since the minimum distance occurs when   { 0   = 0   or   | 0   = 0   in which case   G   = 0 .

To approximate the volume, let   U   be the planar region corresponding to the surface of the water in the pool, and place   U   on coordinate axes so that   {   and   |   correspond to the dimensions given. Then we de fi ne   i ( {> | )   to be the depth of the water at   ( {> | ) , so the volume of water in the pool is the volume of the solid that lies above the rectangle  U   = [0 >   20]   ×   [0 >   30]   and below the graph of   i ( {> | ) . We can estimate this volume using the Midpoint Rule with   p   = 2   and   q   = 3 , so   { D   = 100 . Each subrectangle with its midpoint is shown in the   fi gure. Then  Y   E   2 S  l   = 1 3 S  m   = 1  i    { l > | m     { D   =   { D [ i   (5 >   5) +   i   (5 >   15) +   i   (5 >   25) +   i   (15 >   5) +   i   (15 >   15) +   i   (15 >   25)] = 100(3 + 7 + 10 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 3600  Thus, we estimate that the pool contains   3600   cubic feet of water. Alternatively, we can approximate the volume with a Riemann sum where   p   = 4 ,   q   = 6   and the sample points are taken to be, for example, the upper right corner of each subrectangle. Then   { D   = 25   and  Y   E   4 S  l   = 1 6 S  m   = 1  i   ( { l > | m   )   { D  = 25[3 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 10 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4] = 25(140) = 3500  So we estimate that the pool contains   3500   ft 3   of water.  7.   The values of   i   ( {> | ) =   s 52   3   { 2   3   | 2   get smaller as we move farther from the origin, so on any of the subrectangles in the problem, the function will have its largest value at the lower left corner of the subrectangle and its smallest value at the upper right corner, and any other value will lie between these two. So using these subrectangles we have   X ? Y ? O . (Note that this is true no matter how   U   is divided into subrectangles.)  8.   Divide   U   into 4 equal rectangles (squares) and identify the midpoint of each subrectangle as shown in the   fi gure. The area of each subrectangle is   { D   = 1 , so using the contour map to estimate the function values at each midpoint, we have  ] ]  U  i   ( {> | )   gD   E   2 S  l   = 1 2 S  m   = 1  i    { l > | m     { D   =   i      1 2   >   1 2     { D   +   i      1 2   >   3 2     { D   +   i      3 2   >   1 2     { D   +   i    3 2   >   3 2     { D  E   (1 = 3)(1) + (3 = 3)(1) + (3 = 2)(1) + (5 = 2)(1) = 13 = 0  You could improve the estimate by increasing   p   and   q   to use a larger number of smaller subrectangles.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

To calculate the estimates using a programmable calculator, we can use an algorithm similar to that of Exercise 4.1.9 [ET 5.1.9]. In Maple, we can de fi ne the function  i   ( {> | ) =   I 1 +   {h 3 |   (calling it   f ), load the   student   package, and then use the command  middlesum(middlesum(f,x = 0..1,m), y = 0..1,m);  to get the estimate with   q   =   p 2   squares of equal size.

Let   i ( {> | ) =   {   3   |  ( {   +   | ) 3   . Then a CAS gives   U   1 0  U   1 0   i   ( {> | )   g| g{   =   1 2   and   U   1 0  U   1 0   i ( {> | )   g{ g|   =   3   1 2   . To explain the seeming violation of Fubini’s Theorem, note that   i   has an in fi nite discontinuity at   (0 >   0)   and thus does not satisfy the conditions of Fubini’s Theorem. In fact, both iterated integrals involve improper integrals which diverge at their lower limits of integration.  40.   (a) Loosely speaking, Fubini’s Theorem says that the order of integration of a function of two variables does not affect the value of the double integral, while Clairaut’s Theorem says that the order of differentiation of such a function does not affect the value of the second-order derivative. Also, both theorems require continuity (though Fubini’s allows a   fi nite number of smooth curves to contain discontinuities). (b) To   fi nd   j {|   , we   fi rst hold   |   constant and use the single-variable Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1:  j {   =   g g{  j ( {> | ) =   g g{  ]   { d  ]   | f  i   ( v> w )   gw    gv   =  ]   | f  i   ( {> w )   gw . Now we use the Fundamental Theorem again:  j {|   =   g g|  ]   | f  i   ( {> w )   gw   =   i   ( {> | ) . To   fi nd   j |{ , we   fi rst use Fubini’s Theorem to   fi nd that   U   { d  U   | f   i   ( v> w )   gw gv   =   U   | f  U   { d   i   ( v> w )   gw gv , and then use the Fundamental Theorem twice, as above, to get   j |{   =   i   ( {> | ) .

The desired solid is shown in the   fi rst graph. From the second graph, we estimate that   |   = cos   {   intersects   |   =   {   at  {   E   0 = 7391 . Therefore the volume of the solid is  Y   E   U   0 = 7391 0  U   cos   { {   } g| g{   =   U   0 = 7391 0  U   cos   { {   { g| g{   =   U   0 = 7391 0   {|  |   = cos   { |   =   {   g{  =   U   0 = 7391 0   ( {   cos   {   3   { 2 )   g{   =    cos   {   +   {   sin   {   3   1 3   { 3  0 = 7391 0   E   0 = 1024  Note:   There is a different solid which can also be construed to satisfy the conditions stated in the exercise. This is the solid bounded by all of the given surfaces, as well as the plane   |   = 0 . In case you calculated the volume of this solid and want to check your work, its volume is   Y   E   U   0 = 7391 0  U   {  0   { g| g{   +   U   @ 2 0 = 7391  U   cos   {  0   { g| g{   E   0 = 4684 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  SECTION 15.3   DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER GENERAL REGIONS   ¤   533 63.   First we can write   UU  G   ( {   + 2)   gD   =   UU  G   { gD   +   UU  G   2   gD . But   i   ( {> | ) =   {   is an odd function with respect to   {   [that is,   i   ( 3 {> | ) =   3 i   ( {> | ) ] and   G   is symmetric with respect to   { . Consequently, the volume above   G   and below the graph of   i   is the same as the volume below   G   and above the graph of   i   , so  UU  G   { gD   = 0 . Also,   UU  G   2   gD   = 2   ·   D ( G ) = 2   ·   1 2    (3) 2   = 9    since   G   is a half disk of radius 3. Thus   UU  G   ( {   + 2)   gD   = 0 + 9    = 9  .  64.   The graph of   i   ( {> | ) =   s U 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   is the top half of the sphere   { 2   +   | 2   +   } 2   =   U 2 , centered at the origin with radius  U , and   G   is the disk in the   {| -plane also centered at the origin with radius   U . Thus   UU  G  s U 2   3   { 2   3   | 2   gD   represents the volume of a half ball of radius   U   which is   1 2   ·   4 3   U 3   =   2 3   U 3 .  65.   We can write   UU  G   (2 {   + 3 | )   gD   =   UU  G   2 { gD   +   UU  G   3 | gD .   UU  G   2 { gD   represents the volume of the solid lying under the plane   }   = 2 {   and above the rectangle   G . This solid region is a triangular cylinder with length   e   and whose cross-section is a triangle with width   d   and height   2 d . (See the   fi rst   fi gure.) Thus its volume is   1 2   ·   d   ·   2 d   ·   e   =   d 2 e . Similarly,   UU  G   3 | gD   represents the volume of a triangular cylinder with length   d , triangular cross-section with width   e   and height   3 e , and volume   1 2   ·   e   ·   3 e   ·   d   =   3 2   de 2 . (See the second   fi gure.) Thus  UU  G   (2 {   + 3 | )   gD   =   d 2 e   +   3 2   de 2  66.   In the   fi rst quadrant,   {   and   |   are positive and the boundary of   G   is   {   +   |   = 1 . But   G   is symmetric with respect to both axes because of the absolute values, so the region of integration is the square shown at the left. To evaluate the double integral, we   fi rst write  UU  G   (2 +   { 2 | 3   3   | 2   sin   { )   gD   =   UU  G   2   gD   +   UU  G   { 2 | 3   gD   3   UU  G   | 2   sin   { gD . Now   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2 | 3   is odd with respect to   |   [that is,   i   ( {>   3 | ) =   3 i ( {> | ) ] and   G   is symmetric with respect to   | , so   UU  G   { 2 | 3   gD   = 0 . Similarly,   j ( {> | ) =   | 2   sin   {   is odd with respect to   {   [since   j ( 3 {> | ) =   3 j ( {> | ) ] and   G   is symmetric with respect to   { , so   UU  G   | 2   sin   { gD   = 0 .   G   is a square with side length   I 2 , so   UU  G   2   gD   = 2   ·   D ( G ) = 2  I 2    2   = 4 , and  UU  G   (2 +   { 2 | 3   3   | 2   sin   { )   gD   = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Now   d{ 3   is odd with respect to   {   and   e| 3   is odd with respect to   | , and the region of integration is symmetric with respect to both   {   and   | , so   UU  G   d{ 3   gD   =   UU  G   e| 3   gD   = 0 .  UU  G  I d 2   3   { 2   gD   represents the volume of the solid region under the graph of   }   =   I d 2   3   { 2   and above the rectangle   G , namely a half circular cylinder with radius   d   and length   2 e   (see the   fi gure) whose volume is  1 2   ·   u 2 k   =   1 2   d 2 (2 e ) =   d 2 e .

To   fi nd the equations of the boundary curves, we require that the  } -values of the two surfaces be the same. In Maple, we use the command  solve(4-xˆ2-yˆ2=1-x-y,y);   and in Mathematica, we use  Solve[4-xˆ2-yˆ2==1-x-y,y] . We   fi nd that the curves have equations   |   =  1   ±   I 13 + 4 {   3   4 { 2  2   . To   fi nd the two points of intersection of these curves, we use the CAS to solve   13 + 4 {   3   4 { 2   = 0 ,   fi nding that  {   =   1   ±   I 14 2   . So, using the CAS to evaluate the integral, the volume of intersection is  Y   =  ]   ( 1 +   I 14   ) @ 2  ( 1   3  I 14   ) @ 2  ]     1 +  I 13 + 4 {   3   4 { 2     @ 2    1   3  I 13 + 4 {   3   4 { 2     @ 2  [(4   3   { 2   3   | 2 )   3   (1   3   {   3   | )]   g| g{   =  49   8  15.4   Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates 1.

The surface of the water in the pool is a circular disk   G   with radius   20   ft. If we place   G   on coordinate axes with the origin at the center of   G   and de fi ne   i   ( {> | )   to be the depth of the water at   ( {> | ) , then the volume of water in the pool is the volume of the solid that lies above   G   =   ( {> | )   |   { 2   +   | 2   $   400   and below the graph of   i   ( {> | ) . We can associate north with the positive   | -direction, so we are given that the depth is constant in the   { -direction and the depth increases linearly in the  | -direction from   i   (0 >   3 20) = 2   to   i   (0 >   20) = 7 . The trace in the   |} -plane is a line segment from   (0 >   3 20 >   2)   to   (0 >   20 >   7) . The slope of this line is   7   3   2 20   3   ( 3 20)   =   1 8   , so an equation of the line is   }   3   7 =   1 8   ( |   3   20)   i   }   =   1 8   |   +   9 2   . Since   i   ( {> | )   is independent of   { ,   i ( {> | ) =   1 8   |   +   9 2   . Thus the volume is given by   UU  G   i ( {> | )   gD , which is most conveniently evaluated using polar coordinates. Then   G   =   { ( u>  )   |   0   $   u   $   20 ,   0   $      $   2  }   and substituting   {   =   u   cos    ,   |   =   u   sin      the integral becomes  U   2   0  U   20 0     1 8   u   sin      +   9 2     u gu g   =   U   2   0     1 24   u 3   sin      +   9 4   u 2  u   = 20  u   = 0   g   =   U   2   0     1000 3   sin      + 900    g  =    3   1000 3   cos      + 900   2   0   = 1800   Thus the pool contains   1800    E   5655   ft 3   of water.  36.

Thus the surface area of the entire sphere is   4 d 2 .  23.   If we project the surface onto the   {} -plane, then the surface lies “above” the disk   { 2   +   } 2   $   25   in the   {} -plane. We have   |   =   i   ( {> } ) =   { 2   +   } 2   and, adapting Formula 2, the area of the surface is  D ( V ) =   UU  { 2 + } 2 $ 25  s [ i { ( {> } )] 2   + [ i }   ( {> } )] 2   + 1   gD   =   UU  { 2 + } 2 $ 25  I 4 { 2   + 4 } 2   + 1   gD  Converting to polar coordinates   {   =   u   cos    ,   }   =   u   sin      we have  D ( V ) =   U   2   0  U   5 0  I 4 u 2   + 1   u gu g   =   U   2   0   g   U   5 0   u (4 u 2   + 1) 1 @ 2   gu   =          2   0  k   1 12   (4 u 2   + 1) 3 @ 2  l 5 0  =     6   101   I 101   3   1   24.   First we   fi nd the area of the face of the surface that intersects the positive   | -axis. As in Exercise 23, we can project the face onto the   {} -plane, so the surface lies “above” the disk   { 2   +   } 2   $   1 . Then   |   =   i   ( {> } ) =   I 1   3   } 2   and the area is  D   ( V ) =  ] ]  { 2 + } 2 $ 1  s [ i { ( {> } )] 2   + [ i }   ( {> } )] 2   + 1   gD   =  ] ]  { 2 + } 2 $ 1  v  0 +     3 }  I 1   3   } 2   2  + 1   gD  =  ] ]  { 2 + } 2 $ 1  v  } 2  1   3   } 2   + 1   gD   =  ]   1  3 1  ]   I 1 3 } 2  3  I 1 3 } 2  1  I 1   3   } 2   g{ g}  = 4  ]   1 0  ]   I 1 3 } 2  0  1  I 1   3   } 2   g{ g}   [by the symmetry of the surface] This integral is improper (when   }   = 1 ), so  D   ( V ) =   lim  w < 1    4  ]   w  0  ]   I 1 3 } 2  0  1  I 1   3   } 2   g{ g}   =   lim  w < 1    4  ]   w  0  I 1   3   } 2  I 1   3   } 2   g}   =   lim  w < 1    4  ]   w  0  g}   =   lim  w < 1    4 w   = 4 .

For if   H   contains some region   I   where the integrand is negative, the integral could be increased by excluding   I   from   H , and if   H   fails to contain some part   J   of the region where the integrand is positive, the integral could be increased by including   J   in   H . So we require that   { 2   + 2 | 2   + 3 } 2   $   1 . This describes the region bounded by the ellipsoid   { 2   + 2 | 2   + 3 } 2   = 1 .

(b)   u 2   = ( 3 2) 2   + (2 I 3) 2   = 16   so   u   = 4 ;   tan      =   2 I 3  3 2   =   3 I 3   and the point    3 2 >   2 I 3      is in the second quadrant of the  {| -plane, so      =   2   3   + 2 q ;   }   = 3 . Thus, one set of cylindrical coordinates is    4 >   2   3   >   3  .  4.   (a)   u 2   =    2   I 3    2   + 2 2   = 16   so   u   = 4 ;   tan      =   2 2 I 3   =   1 I 3   and the point    2   I 3 >   2    is in the   fi rst quadrant of the   {| -plane, so     =     6   + 2 q ;   }   =   3 1 . Thus, one set of cylindrical coordinates is    4 >     6   >   3 1  . (b)   u 2   = 4 2   + ( 3 3) 2   = 25   so   u   = 5 ;   tan      =   3 3 4   and the point   (4 >   3 3)   is in the fourth quadrant of the   {| -plane, so      = tan 3 1    3   3 4     + 2 q   E 3 0 = 64 + 2 q ;   }   = 2 . Thus, one set of cylindrical coordinates is    5 >   tan 3 1    3   3 4     + 2 >   2    E   (5 >   5 = 64 >   2) .  5.   Since      =     4   but   u   and   }   may vary, the surface is a vertical half-plane including the   } -axis and intersecting the   {| -plane in the half-line   |   =   { ,   {   D   0 .  6.   Since   u   = 5 ,   { 2   +   | 2   = 25   and the surface is a circular cylinder with radius   5   and axis the   } -axis.  7.   }   = 4   3   u 2   = 4   3   ( { 2   +   | 2 )   or   4   3   { 2   3   | 2 , so the surface is a circular paraboloid with vertex   (0 >   0 >   4) , axis the   } -axis, and opening downward.  8.   Since   2 u 2   +   } 2   = 1   and   u 2   =   { 2   +   | 2 , we have   2( { 2   +   | 2 ) +   } 2   = 1   or   2 { 2   + 2 | 2   +   } 2   = 1 , an ellipsoid centered at the origin with intercepts   {   =   ±   1 I 2   ,   |   =   ±   1 I 2   ,   }   =   ± 1 .  9.   (a) Substituting   { 2   +   | 2   =   u 2   and   {   =   u   cos    , the equation   { 2   3   {   +   | 2   +   } 2   = 1   becomes   u 2   3   u   cos      +   } 2   = 1   or  } 2   = 1 +   u   cos      3   u 2 . (b) Substituting   {   =   u   cos      and   |   =   u   sin    , the equation   }   =   { 2   3   | 2   becomes  }   = ( u   cos    ) 2   3   ( u   sin    ) 2   =   u 2 (cos 2      3   sin 2    )   or   }   =   u 2   cos 2  .  10.   (a) Substituting   {   =   u   cos      and   |   =   u   sin    , the equation   3 {   + 2 |   +   }   = 6   becomes   3 u   cos      + 2 u   sin      +   }   = 6   or  }   = 6   3   u (3 cos      + 2 sin    ) . (b) The equation   3 { 2   3   | 2   +   } 2   = 1   can be written as   3 ( { 2   +   | 2 ) +   } 2   = 1   which becomes   3 u 2   +   } 2   = 1   or   } 2   = 1 +   u 2  in cylindrical coordinates.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

We can position the cylindrical shell vertically so that its axis coincides with the   } -axis and its base lies in the   {| -plane.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  582   ¤   CHAPTER 15   MULTIPLE INTEGRALS  DISCOVERY PROJECT   The Intersection of Three Cylinders 1.   The three cylinders in the illustration in the text can be visualized as representing the surfaces   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 ,  { 2   +   } 2   = 1 , and   | 2   +   } 2   = 1 . Then we sketch the solid of intersection with the coordinate axes and equations indicated. To be more precise, we start by   fi nding the bounding curves of the solid (shown in the   fi rst graph below) enclosed by the two cylinders   { 2   +   } 2   = 1   and  | 2   +   } 2   = 1 :   {   =   ± |   =   ± I 1   3   } 2   are the symmetric equations, and these can be expressed parametrically as   {   =   v ,   |   =   ± v> }   =   ± I 1   3   v 2 ,   3 1   $   v   $   1 . Now the cylinder  { 2   +   | 2   = 1   intersects these curves at the eight points    ±   1 I 2   >   ±   1 I 2   >   ±   1 I 2    . The resulting solid has twelve curved faces bounded by “edges” which are arcs of circles, as shown in the third diagram. Each cylinder de fi nes four of the twelve faces.  2.   To   fi nd the volume, we split the solid into sixteen congruent pieces, one of which lies in the part of the   fi rst octant with  0   $      $     4   . (Naturally, we use cylindrical coordinates!) This piece is described by  ( u> > } )   |   0   $   u   $   1 >   0   $      $     4   ,   0   $   }   $  I 1   3   { 2   , and so, substituting   {   =   u   cos    , the volume of the entire solid is  Y   = 16   U   @ 4 0  U   1 0  U   I 1 3 { 2  0   u g} gu g  = 16   U   @ 4 0  U   1 0   u   I 1   3   u 2   cos 2    gu g  = 16   3   8   I 2   E   4 = 6863  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  DISCOVERY PROJECT   THE INTERSECTION OF THREE CYLINDERS   ¤   583 3.   To graph the edges of the solid, we use parametrized curves similar to those found in Problem 1 for the intersection of two cylinders. We must restrict the parameter intervals so that each arc extends exactly to the desired vertex. One possible set of parametric equations (with all sign choices allowed) is  {   =   u ,   |   =   ± u ,   }   =   ± I 1   3   u 2 ,   3   1 I 2   $   u   $   1 I 2   ;  {   =   ± v ,   |   =   ± I 1   3   v 2 ,   }   =   v ,   3   1 I 2   $   v   $   1 I 2   ;  {   =   ± I 1   3   w 2 ,   |   =   w ,   }   =   ± w ,   3   1 I 2   $   w   $   1 I 2   .  4.   Let the three cylinders be   { 2   +   | 2   =   d 2 ,   { 2   +   } 2   = 1 , and   | 2   +   } 2   = 1 . If   d ?   1 , then the four faces de fi ned by the cylinder   { 2   +   | 2   = 1   in Problem 1 collapse into a single face, as in the   fi rst graph. If   1   ? d ?   I 2 , then each pair of vertically opposed faces, de fi ned by one of the other two cylinders, collapse into a single face, as in the second graph. If   d   D  I 2 , then the vertical cylinder encloses the solid of intersection of the other two cylinders completely, so the solid of intersection coincides with the solid of intersection of the two cylinders   { 2   +   } 2   = 1   and  | 2   +   } 2   = 1 , as illustrated in Problem 1. If we were to vary   e   or   f   instead of   d , we would get solids with the same shape, but differently oriented.  d   = 0 = 95 ,   e   =   f   = 1   d   = 1 = 1 ,   e   =   f   = 1  5.   If   d ?   1 , the solid looks similar to the   fi rst graph in Problem 4. As in Problem 2, we split the solid into sixteen congruent pieces, one of which can be described as the solid above the polar region   ( u>  )   |   0   $   u   $   d ,   0   $      $     4   in the   {| -plane and below the surface   }   =   I 1   3   { 2   =   I 1   3   u 2   cos 2    . Thus, the total volume is   Y   = 16   U   @ 4 0  U   d  0  I 1   3   u 2   cos 2    u gu g . If   d A   1   and   d ?   I 2 , we have a solid similar to the second graph in Problem 4. Its intersection with the   {| -plane is graphed at the right.

In particular: Montréal:   h 783 = 67 >   3 2662 = 67 >   2824 = 47 i   Los Angeles:   h 3 1552 = 80 >   3 2889 = 91 >   2217 = 84 i  To   fi nd the angle      between these two vectors we use the dot product:  h 783 = 67 >   3 2662 = 67 >   2824 = 47 i · h 3 1552 = 80 >   3 2889 = 91 >   2217 = 84 i   = (3960) 2   cos      i   cos      E   0 = 8126   i     E   0 = 6223   rad.

For the hollow cylinder, we consider its entire mass to lie a distance   u   from the axis of rotation, so   { 2   +   | 2   =   u 2   is a constant. We express the density in terms of mass per unit area as      =   p  2 uc   , and then the moment of inertia is calculated as a double integral:   L }   =  ] ]  ( { 2   +   | 2 )   p  2 uc  gD   =   pu 2  2 uc  ] ]  gD   =   pu 2 , so   L W   =   L }  pu 2   = 1 .  5.   The volume of such a ball is   4 3    ( u 3   3   d 3 ) =   4 3   u (1   3   e 3 ) , and so its density is   p  4 3   u 3 (1   3   e 3 )   .

The transformation maps the boundary of   V   to the boundary of the image   U , so we   fi rst look at side   V 1   in the   xy -plane.   V 1   is described by   y   = 0 ,   0   $   x   $   3 , so   {   = 2 x   + 3 y   = 2 x   and   |   =   x   3   y   =   x . Eliminating   x , we have   {   = 2 | ,   0   $   {   $   6 .   V 2   is the line segment   x   = 3 ,   0   $   y   $   2 , so   {   = 6 + 3 y   and   |   = 3   3   y . Then   y   = 3   3   |   i   {   = 6 + 3(3   3   | ) = 15   3   3 | ,  6   $   {   $   12 .   V 3   is the line segment   y   = 2 ,   0   $   x   $   3 , so   {   = 2 x   + 6   and   |   =   x   3   2 , giving   x   =   |   + 2   i   {   = 2 |   + 10 ,  6   $   {   $   12 . Finally,   V 4   is the segment   x   = 0 ,   0   $   y   $   2 , so   {   = 3 y   and   |   =   3 y   i   {   =   3 3 | ,   0   $   {   $   6 . The image of set   V   is the region   U   shown in the   {| -plane, a parallelogram bounded by these four segments.  8.   V 1   is the line segment   y   = 0 ,   0   $   x   $   1 , so   {   =   y   = 0   and   |   =   x (1 +   y 2 ) =   x . Since   0   $   x   $   1 , the image is the line segment   {   = 0 ,   0   $   |   $   1 .   V 2   is the segment   x   = 1 ,   0   $   y   $   1 , so   {   =   y   and   |   =   x (1 +   y 2 ) = 1 +   { 2 . Thus the image is the portion of the parabola   |   = 1 +   { 2   for   0   $   {   $   1 .   V 3   is the segment   y   = 1 ,   0   $   x   $   1 , so   {   = 1   and   |   = 2 x . The image is the segment   {   = 1 ,   0   $   |   $   2 .   V 4   is described by   x   = 0 ,   0   $   y   $   1 , so   0   $   {   =   y   $   1   and   |   =   x (1 +   y 2 ) = 0 . The image is the line segment   |   = 0 ,   0   $   {   $   1 . Thus, the image of   V   is the region   U   bounded by the parabola   |   = 1 +   { 2 , the  { -axis, and the lines   {   = 0 ,   {   = 1 .  9.   V 1   is the line segment   x   =   y ,   0   $   x   $   1 , so   |   =   y   =   x   and   {   =   x 2   =   | 2 . Since   0   $   x   $   1 , the image is the portion of the parabola   {   =   | 2 ,   0   $   |   $   1 .   V 2   is the segment   y   = 1 ,   0   $   x   $   1 , thus   |   =   y   = 1   and   {   =   x 2 , so   0   $   {   $   1 . The image is the line segment   |   = 1 ,   0   $   {   $   1 .   V 3   is the segment   x   = 0 ,   0   $   y   $   1 , so   {   =   x 2   = 0   and   |   =   y   i   0   $   |   $   1 . The image is the segment   {   = 0 ,   0   $   |   $   1 .

U   is a parallelogram enclosed by the parallel lines   |   = 2 {   3   1 ,   |   = 2 {   + 1   and the parallel lines   |   = 1   3   { ,   |   = 3   3   { . The  fi rst pair of equations can be written as   |   3   2 {   =   3 1 ,   |   3   2 {   = 1 . If we let   x   =   |   3   2 {   then these lines are mapped to the vertical lines   x   =   3 1 ,   x   = 1   in the   xy -plane. Similarly, the second pair of equations can be written as   {   +   |   = 1 ,   {   +   |   = 3 , and setting   y   =   {   +   |   maps these lines to the horizontal lines   y   = 1 ,   y   = 3   in the   xy -plane. Boundary curves are mapped to boundary curves under a transformation, so here the equations   x   =   |   3   2 { ,   y   =   {   +   |   de fi ne a transformation   W   3 1   that maps   U   in the   {| -plane to the square   V   enclosed by the lines   x   =   3 1 ,   x   = 1 ,   y   = 1 ,   y   = 3   in the   xy -plane.

Thus one possible transformation   W   (there are many) is given by   {   =   1 3   ( y   3   x ) ,   |   =   1 3   ( x   + 2 y ) .  12.

If we converted a double integral over   U   to polar coordinates the resulting region of integration is a rectangle (in the   u -plane), so we can create a transformation   W   here by letting   x   play the role of   u   and   y   the role of    . Thus   W   is de fi ned by   {   =   x   cos   y ,   |   =   x   sin   y   and   W   maps the rectangle   V   =   ( x> y )   |   1   $   x   $  I 2 >   0   $   y   $   @ 2  in the   xy -plane to   U   in the   {| -plane.  14.

This says that the average value of   i   over   G   lies between   p   and   P . But   i   is continuous on   G   and takes on the values   p   and   P , and so by the Intermediate Value Theorem must take on all values between   p   and   P .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

So Laplace’s Equation in spherical coordinates is as stated.  10.   (a) Consider a polar division of the disk, similar to that in Figure 15.4.4, where   0 =    0   ?  1   ?  2   ?   · · ·   ?  q   = 2  ,  0 =   u 1   ? u 2   ?   · · ·   ? u p   =   U , and where the polar subrectangle   U lm   , as well as   u W  l   ,    W  m   ,   { u   and   {    are the same as in that  fi gure. Thus   { D l   =   u W  l   { u   {  . The mass of   U lm   is      { D l , and its distance from   p   is   v lm   E  t  ( u W  l   ) 2   +   g 2 . According to Newton’s Law of Gravitation, the force of attraction experienced by   p   due to this polar subrectangle is in the direction from   p   towards   U lm   and has magnitude   Jp   { D l  v 2  lm  . The symmetry of the lamina with respect to the   { - and   | -axes and the position of   p   are such that all horizontal components of the gravitational force cancel, so that the total force is simply in the   } -direction. Thus, we need only be concerned with the components of this vertical force; that is,   Jp   { D l  v 2  lm  sin    , where      is the angle between the origin,   u W  l   and the mass   p . Thus   sin      =   g v lm  and the previous result becomes  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

The volume is   Y   =   UUU  U   gY   where   U   is the solid region given. From Exercise 15.10.21(a), the transformation   {   =   dx ,  |   =   ey ,   }   =   fz   maps the unit ball   x 2   +   y 2   +   z 2   $   1   to the solid ellipsoid  { 2  d 2   +   | 2  e   2   +   } 2  f 2   $   1   with   C ( {> |> } )  C ( x> y> z )  =   def . The same transformation maps the plane   x   +   y   +   z   = 1   to   { d   +   | e   +   } f   = 1 . Thus the region   U   in   {|} -space corresponds to the region   V   in   xyz -space consisting of the smaller piece of the unit ball cut off by the plane   x   +   y   +   z   = 1 , a “cap of a sphere” (see the   fi gure).  We will need to compute the volume of   V , but   fi rst consider the general case where a horizontal plane slices the upper portion of a sphere of radius   u   to produce a cap of height   k . We use spherical coordinates. From the   fi gure, a line through the origin at angle   !   from the   } -axis intersects the plane when   cos   !   = ( u   3   k ) @d   i  d   = ( u   3   k ) @   cos   ! , and the line passes through the outer rim of the cap when  d   =   u   i   cos   !   = ( u   3   k ) @u   i   !   = cos 3 1   (( u   3   k ) @u ) .

To determine the height   k   of the cap cut from the unit ball by the plane  x   +   y   +   z   = 1 , note that the line   x   =   y   =   z   passes through the origin with direction vector   h 1 >   1 >   1 i   which is perpendicular to the plane. Therefore this line coincides with a radius of the sphere that passes through the center of the cap and  k   is measured along this line.

All vectors in quadrants I and II have positive   { -components while all vectors in quadrants III and IV have negative   { -components. In addition, vectors along the line   |   =   {   are horizontal, and vectors get shorter as we approach the origin.  13.   F ( {> | ) =   h |> |   + 2 i   corresponds to graph I. As in Exercise 12, all vectors in quadrants I and II have positive   { -components while all vectors in quadrants III and IV have negative   { -components.Vectors along the line   |   =   3 2   are horizontal, and the vectors are independent of   {   (vectors along horizontal lines are identical).  14.   F ( {> | ) =   h cos( {   +   | ) > { i   corresponds to graph II. All vectors in quadrants I and IV have positive   | -components while all vectors in quadrants II and III have negative   | -components. Also, the   | -components of vectors along any vertical line remain constant while the   { -component oscillates.  15.   F ( {> |> } ) =   i   + 2   j   + 3   k   corresponds to graph IV, since all vectors have identical length and direction.  16.   F ( {> |> } ) =   i   + 2   j   +   }   k   corresponds to graph I, since the horizontal vector components remain constant, but the vectors above the   {| -plane point generally upward while the vectors below the   {| -plane point generally downward.  17.   F ( {> |> } ) =   {   i   +   |   j   + 3   k   corresponds to graph III; the projection of each vector onto the   {| -plane is   {   i   +   |   j , which points away from the origin, and the vectors point generally upward because their   } -components are all   3 .  18.   F ( {> |> } ) =   {   i   +   |   j   +   }   k   corresponds to graph II; each vector   F ( {> |> } )   has the same length and direction as the position vector of the point   ( {> |> } ) , and therefore the vectors all point directly away from the origin.  19.  The vector   fi eld seems to have very short vectors near the line   |   = 2 { . For   F ( {> | ) =   h 0 >   0 i   we must have   | 2   3   2 {|   = 0   and   3 {|   3   6 { 2   = 0 . The   fi rst equation holds if   |   = 0   or   |   = 2 { , and the second holds if  {   = 0   or   |   = 2 { . So both equations hold [and thus   F ( {> | ) =   0 ] along the line   |   = 2 { .  20.   From the graph, it appears that all of the vectors in the   fi eld lie on lines through the origin, and that the vectors have very small magnitudes near the circle   | x |   = 2   and near the origin. Note that   F ( x ) =   0   C  u ( u   3   2) = 0   C   u   = 0   or   2 , so as we suspected,   F ( x ) =   0   for  | x |   = 2   and for   | x |   = 0 . Note that where   u 2   3   u ?   0 , the vectors point towards the origin, and where   u 2   3   u A   0 , they point away from the origin.  21.   i   ( {> | ) =   {h {|   i Q i   ( {> | ) =   i { ( {> | )   i   +   i |   ( {> | )   j   = ( {h {|   ·   |   +   h {|   )   i   + ( {h {|   ·   { )   j   = ( {|   + 1) h {|   i   +   { 2 h {|   j  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Q i   ( {> | )   is not de fi ned at the origin, but elsewhere all vectors have length   1  and point away from the origin.  27.

Thus, each vector   Q i   ( {> | )   has the same direction and twice the length of the position vector of the point   ( {> | ) , so the vectors all point directly away from the origin and their lengths increase as we move away from the origin. Hence,   Q i   is graph III.  30.   i   ( {> | ) =   { ( {   +   | ) =   { 2   +   {|   i   Q i   ( {> | ) = (2 {   +   | )   i   +   {   j . The   | -component of each vector is   { , so the vectors point upward in quadrants I and IV and downward in quadrants II and III. Also, the   { -component of each vector is   0   along the line   |   =   3 2 {   so the vectors are vertical there. Thus,   Q i   is graph IV.  31.   i   ( {> | ) = ( {   +   | ) 2   i   Q i   ( {> | ) = 2( {   +   | )   i   + 2( {   +   | )   j . The   { - and   | -components of each vector are equal, so all vectors are parallel to the line   |   =   { . The vectors are   0   along the line   |   =   3 {   and their length increases as the distance from this line increases. Thus,   Q i   is graph II.  32.   i   ( {> | ) = sin   s { 2   +   | 2   i Q i   ( {> | ) =  k  cos   s { 2   +   | 2   ·   1 2   ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 3 1 @ 2 (2 { )  l  i   +  k  cos   s { 2   +   | 2   ·   1 2   ( { 2   +   | 2 ) 3 1 @ 2 (2 | )  l  j  =  cos   s { 2   +   | 2  s { 2   +   | 2   {   i   +  cos   s { 2   +   | 2  s { 2   +   | 2   |   j   or   cos   s { 2   +   | 2  s { 2   +   | 2   (   {   i   +   |   j )  Thus each vector is a scalar multiple of its position vector, so the vectors point toward or away from the origin with length that changes in a periodic fashion as we move away from the origin.   Q i   is graph I.  33.   At   w   = 3   the particle is at   (2 >   1)   so its velocity is   V (2 >   1) =   h 4 >   3 i . After 0.01 units of time, the particle’s change in location should be approximately   0 = 01   V (2 >   1) = 0 = 01   h 4 >   3 i   =   h 0 = 04 >   0 = 03 i , so the particle should be approximately at the point   (2 = 04 >   1 = 03) .  34.   At   w   = 1   the particle is at   (1 >   3)   so its velocity is   F (1 >   3) =   h 1 >   3 1 i . After 0.05 units of time, the particle’s change in location should be approximately   0 = 05   F (1 >   3) = 0 = 05   h 1 >   3 1 i   =   h 0 = 05 >   3 0 = 05 i , so the particle should be approximately at the point   (1 = 05 >   2 = 95) .  35.   (a) We sketch the vector   fi eld   F ( {> | ) =   {   i   3   |   j   along with several approximate   fl ow lines. The   fl ow lines appear to be hyperbolas with shape similar to the graph of  |   =   ± 1 @{ , so we might guess that the   fl ow lines have equations   |   =   F@{ . (b) If   {   =   { ( w )   and   |   =   | ( w )   are parametric equations of a   fl ow line, then the velocity vector of the   fl ow line at the point   ( {> | )   is   { 0 ( w )   i   +   | 0   ( w )   j . Since the velocity vectors coincide with the vectors in the vector   fi eld, we have  { 0 ( w )   i   +   | 0 ( w )   j   =   {   i   3   |   j   i   g{@gw   =   { ,   g|@gw   =   3 | .

(a) Along the line   {   =   3 3 , the vectors of   F   have positive   | -components, so since the path goes upward, the integrand   F   ·   T   is always positive. Therefore   U  F 1   F   ·   g r   =   U  F 1   F   ·   T   gv   is positive. (b) All of the (nonzero)   fi eld vectors along the circle with radius   3   are pointed in the clockwise direction, that is, opposite the direction to the path. So   F   ·   T   is negative, and therefore   U  F 2   F   ·   g r   =   U  F 2   F   ·   T   gv   is negative.  18.   Vectors starting on   F 1   point in roughly the same direction as   F 1 , so the tangential component   F   ·   T   is positive. Then  U  F 1   F   ·   g r   =   U  F 1   F   ·   T   gv   is positive. On the other hand, no vectors starting on   F 2   point in the same direction as   F 2 , while some vectors point in roughly the opposite direction, so we would expect   U  F 2   F   ·   g r   =   U  F 2   F   ·   T   gv   to be negative.  19.   r ( w ) = 11 w 4   i   +   w 3   j , so   F ( r ( w )) = (11 w 4 )( w 3 )   i   + 3( w 3 ) 2   j   = 11 w 7   i   + 3 w 6   j   and   r 0 ( w ) = 44 w 3   i   + 3 w 2   j .

We graph   F ( {> | ) = ( {   3   | )   i   +   {|   j   and the curve   F . We see that most of the vectors starting on   F   point in roughly the same direction as   F , so for these portions of   F   the tangential component   F   ·   T   is positive. Although some vectors in the third quadrant which start on   F   point in roughly the opposite direction, and hence give negative tangential components, it seems reasonable that the effect of these portions of   F   is outweighed by the positive tangential components. Thus, we would expect  U  F   F   ·   g r   =   U  F   F   ·   T   gv   to be positive. To verify, we evaluate   U  F   F   ·   g r . The curve   F   can be represented by   r ( w ) = 2 cos   w   i   + 2 sin   w   j ,   0   $   w   $   3   2   , so   F ( r ( w )) = (2 cos   w   3   2 sin   w )   i   + 4 cos   w   sin   w   j   and   r 0 ( w ) =   3 2 sin   w   i   + 2 cos   w   j .

We graph   F ( {> | ) =   {  s { 2   +   | 2   i   +   |  s { 2   +   | 2   j   and the curve   F . In the  fi rst quadrant, each vector starting on   F   points in roughly the same direction as   F , so the tangential component   F   ·   T   is positive. In the second quadrant, each vector starting on   F   points in roughly the direction opposite to   F , so  F   ·   T   is negative. Here, it appears that the tangential components in the   fi rst and second quadrants counteract each other, so it seems reasonable to guess that   U  F   F   ·   g r   =   U  F   F   ·   T   gv   is zero. To verify, we evaluate   U  F   F   ·   g r .

In order to generate the graph with Maple, we use the   line   command in the   plottools   package to de fi ne each of the vectors. For example,  v1:=line([0,0],[exp(-1),0]):  generates the vector from the vector   fi eld at the point   (0 >   0)   (but without an arrowhead) and gives it the name   v1 . To show everything on the same screen, we use the   display   command. In Mathematica, we use   ListPlot   (with the  PlotJoined -   A   True   option) to generate the vectors, and then   Show   to show everything on the same screen.  30.

This indicates that the   fi eld does no work on the particle, since the   fi eld never pulls the particle in the direction in which it is going. In other words, at any point along   F ,   F   ·   T   = 0 , and so certainly   U  F   F   ·   g r   = 0   .  33.

If   r ( w ) =   h { ( w ) > | ( w ) > } ( w ) i   then  U  F   r   ·   g r   =   U   e d   h { ( w ) > | ( w ) > } ( w ) i · h { 0 ( w ) > | 0 ( w ) > } 0 ( w ) i   gw   =   U   e d   [ { ( w )   { 0 ( w ) +   | ( w )   | 0 ( w ) +   } ( w )   } 0 ( w )]   gw  =      1 2   [ { ( w )] 2   +   1 2   [ | ( w )] 2   +   1 2   [ } ( w )] 2  e d  =   1 2   [ { ( e )] 2   + [ | ( e )] 2   + [ } ( e )] 2    3    [ { ( d )] 2   + [ | ( d )] 2   + [ } ( d )] 2   =   1 2   | r ( e ) | 2   3   | r ( d ) | 2   51.   The work done in moving the object is   U  F   F   ·   g r   =   U  F   F   ·   T   gv . We can approximate this integral by dividing   F   into  7   segments of equal length   { v   = 2   and approximating   F   ·   T , that is, the tangential component of force, at a point   ( { W  l   > | W  l   )   on each segment. Since   F   is composed of straight line segments,   F   ·   T   is the scalar projection of each force vector onto   F . If we choose   ( { W  l   > | W  l   )   to be the point on the segment closest to the origin, then the work done is  U  F   F   ·   T   gv   E   7 S  l   = 1  [ F ( { W  l   > | W  l   )   ·   T ( { W  l   > | W  l   )]   { v   = [2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1](2) = 22 . Thus, we estimate the work done to be approximately   22   J.  52.   Use the orientation pictured in the   fi gure. Then since   B   is tangent to any circle that lies in the plane perpendicular to the wire,  B   =   | B |   T   where   T   is the unit tangent to the circle   F :   {   =   u   cos    ,   |   =   u   sin    . Thus   B   =   | B | h 3   sin   >   cos    i . Then  U  F   B   ·   g r   =   U   2   0   | B | h 3   sin   >   cos    i · h 3 u   sin   > u   cos    i   g   =   U   2   0   | B |   u g   = 2 u   | B | . (Note that   | B |   here is the magnitude of the   fi eld at a distance   u   from the wire’s center.) But by Ampere’s Law   U  F   B   ·   g r   =    0 L . Hence   | B |   =    0 L@ (2 u ) .  16.3   The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals 1.   F   appears to be a smooth curve, and since   Q i   is continuous, we know   i   is differentiable. Then Theorem 2 says that the value of   U  F   Q i   ·   g r   is simply the difference of the values of   i   at the terminal and initial points of   F . From the graph, this is  50   3   10 = 40 .  2.   F   is represented by the vector function   r ( w ) = ( w 2   + 1)   i   + ( w 3   +   w )   j ,   0   $   w   $   1 , so   r 0 ( w ) = 2 w   i   + (3 w 2   + 1)   j . Since  3 w 2   + 1   6   = 0 , we have   r 0 ( w )   6   =   0 , thus   F   is a smooth curve.   Q i   is continuous, and hence   i   is differentiable, so by Theorem 2 we have   U  F   Q i   ·   g r   =   i   ( r (1))   3   i ( r (0)) =   i   (2 >   2)   3   i (1 >   0) = 9   3   3 = 6 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

But  i |   ( {> | ) =   { 2   cosh   {|   so   j ( | ) =   N   and   i   ( {> | ) =   {   sinh   {|   +   N   is a potential function for   F .  11.   (a)   F   has continuous   fi rst-order partial derivatives and   C C|   2 {|   = 2 {   =   C C{   ( { 2 )   on   R 2 , which is open and simply-connected. Thus,   F   is conservative by Theorem 6. Then we know that the line integral of   F   is independent of path; in particular, the value of   U  F   F   ·   g r   depends only on the endpoints of   F . Since all three curves have the same initial and terminal points,  U  F   F   ·   g r   will have the same value for each curve.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

We know   i { ( {> | ) = 2 {|   and   i |   ( {> | ) =   { 2 . Integrating  i { ( {> | )   with respect to   { , we have   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2 |   +   j ( | ) . Differentiating both sides with respect to   |   gives  i |   ( {> | ) =   { 2   +   j 0 ( | ) , so we must have   { 2   +   j 0 ( | ) =   { 2   i   j 0 ( | ) = 0   i   j ( | ) =   N , a constant. Thus   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2 |   +   N . All three curves start at   (1 >   2)   and end at   (3 >   2) , so by Theorem 2,  U  F   F   ·   g r   =   i   (3 >   2)   3   i   (1 >   2) = 18   3   2 = 16   for each curve.  12.

But   i |   ( {> | ) =   | 2   so  j 0 ( | ) =   | 2   i   j ( | ) =   1 3   | 3   +   N . We can take   N   = 0 , so   i   ( {> | ) =   1 3   { 3   +   1 3   | 3 .

But   i |   ( {> | ) =   { 2 |   so   j 0 ( | ) = 0   i  j ( | ) =   N , a constant. We can take   N   = 0 , so   i ( {> | ) =   1 2   { 2 | 2 . (b) The initial point of   F   is   r (0) = (0 >   1)   and the terminal point is   r (1) = (2 >   1) , so  U  F   F   ·   g r   =   i   (2 >   1)   3   i   (0 >   1) = 2   3   0 = 2 .  14.

But  i { ( {> | ) = (1 +   {| ) h {|   so   j 0 ( { ) = 0   i   j ( { ) =   N . We can take   N   = 0 , so   i   ( {> | ) =   {h {|   . (b) The initial point of   F   is   r (0) = (1 >   0)   and the terminal point is   r ( @ 2) = (0 >   2) , so  U  F   F   ·   g r   =   i   (0 >   2)   3   i   (1 >   0) = 0   3   h 0   =   3 1 .  15.

But  i }   ( {> |> } ) =   {|   + 2 } , so   k 0 ( } ) = 2 }   i   k ( } ) =   } 2   +   N . Hence   i   ( {> |> } ) =   {|}   +   } 2   (taking   N   = 0 ).

But  i |   ( {> |> } ) = 2 {|}   so   j |   ( |> } ) = 0   i   j ( |> } ) =   k ( } ) . Thus   i ( {> |> } ) =   {| 2 }   +   { 2 } 2   +   k ( } )   and  i }   ( {> |> } ) =   {| 2   + 2 { 2 }   +   k 0 ( } ) .

(b)   w   = 0   corresponds to the point   (0 >   1 >   0)   and   w   = 1   corresponds to   (1 >   2 >   1) , so  U  F   F   ·   g r   =   i (1 >   2 >   1)   3   i   (0 >   1 >   0) = 5   3   0 = 5 .  17.

But  i |   ( {> |> } ) =   {   cos   |   + cos   }   so   j |   ( |> } ) = cos   }   i   j ( |> } ) =   |   cos   }   +   k ( } ) . Thus  i   ( {> |> } ) =   {   sin   |   +   |   cos   }   +   k ( } )   and   i }   ( {> |> } ) =   3 |   sin   }   +   k 0 ( } ) .

Thus a potential function   i   exists, and   i { ( {> | ) = 2 {h 3 |  implies   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2 h 3 |   +   j ( | )   and   i |   ( {> | ) =   3 { 2 h 3 |   +   j 0 ( | ) . But   i |   ( {> | ) = 2 |   3   { 2 h 3 |   so  j 0 ( | ) = 2 |   i   j ( | ) =   | 2   +   N . We can take   N   = 0 , so   i   ( {> | ) =   { 2 h 3 |   +   | 2 .

The functions   sin   |   and   {   cos   |   3   sin   |   have continuous   fi rst-order derivatives on   R 2   and  C C|   (sin   | ) = cos   |   =   C C{   ( {   cos   |   3   sin   | ) , so   F ( {> | ) = sin   |   i   + ( {   cos   |   3   sin   | )   j   is a conservative vector   fi eld by Theorem 6 and hence the line integral is independent of path. Thus a potential function   i   exists, and   i { ( {> | ) = sin   |   implies  i   ( {> | ) =   {   sin   |   +   j ( | )   and   i |   ( {> | ) =   {   cos   |   +   j 0 ( | ) .

If   F   is conservative, then   U  F   F   ·   g r   is independent of path. This means that the work done along all piecewise-smooth curves that have the described initial and terminal points is the same. Your reply: It doesn’t matter which curve is chosen.  22.   The curves   F 1   and   F 2   connect the same two points but   U  F 1   F   ·   g r   6   =   U  F 2   F   ·   g r . Thus   F   is not independent of path, and therefore is not conservative.  23.   F ( {> | ) = 2 | 3 @ 2   i   + 3 {   s |   j ,   Z   =   U  F   F   ·   g   r . Since   C (2 | 3 @ 2 ) @C|   = 3   I |   =   C (3 {   s |   ) @C{ , there exists a function   i  such that   Q i   =   F .

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com  SECTION 16.3   THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM FOR LINE INTEGRALS   ¤   641 25.   We know that if the vector   fi eld (call it   F ) is conservative, then around any closed path   F ,   U  F   F   ·   g r   = 0 . But take   F   to be a circle centered at the origin, oriented counterclockwise. All of the   fi eld vectors that start on   F   are roughly in the direction of motion along   F , so the integral around   F   will be positive. Therefore the   fi eld is not conservative.  26.   If a vector   fi eld   F   is conservative, then around any closed path   F ,   U  F   F   ·   g r   = 0 . For any closed path we draw in the   fi eld, it appears that some vectors on the curve point in approximately the same direction as the curve and a similar number point in roughly the opposite direction. (Some appear perpendicular to the curve as well.) Therefore it is plausible that   U  F   F   ·   g r   = 0  for every closed curve   F   which means   F   is conservative.  27.   From the graph, it appears that   F   is conservative, since around all closed paths, the number and size of the   fi eld vectors pointing in directions similar to that of the path seem to be roughly the same as the number and size of the vectors pointing in the opposite direction. To check, we calculate  C C|   (sin   | ) = cos   |   =   C C{   (1 +   {   cos   | ) . Thus   F   is conservative, by Theorem 6.  28.   Q i   ( {> | ) = cos( {   3   2 | )   i   3   2 cos( {   3   2 | )   j  (a) We use Theorem 2:   U  F 1   F   ·   g r   =   U  F 1   Q i   ·   g r   =   i   ( r ( e ))   3   i   ( r ( d ))   where   F 1   starts at   w   =   d   and ends at   w   =   e . So because   i   (0 >   0) = sin 0 = 0   and   i   ( >  ) = sin(    3   2  ) = 0 , one possible curve   F 1   is the straight line from   (0 >   0)   to  ( >  ) ; that is,   r ( w ) =   w   i   +   w   j ,   0   $   w   $   1 . (b) From (a),   U  F 2   F   ·   g r   =   i   ( r ( e ))   3   i   ( r ( d )) . So because   i   (0 >   0) = sin 0 = 0   and   i      2   >   0    = 1 , one possible curve   F 2   is  r ( w ) =     2   w   i ,   0   $   w   $   1 , the straight line from   (0 >   0)   to        2   >   0  .  29.   Since   F   is conservative, there exists a function   i   such that   F   =   Q i   , that is,   S   =   i { ,   T   =   i |   , and   U   =   i }   . Since   S   ,  T , and   U   have continuous   fi rst order partial derivatives, Clairaut’s Theorem says that   CS@C|   =   i {|   =   i |{   =   CT@C{ ,  CS@C}   =   i {}   =   i }{   =   CU@C{ , and   CT@C}   =   i |}   =   i }|   =   CU@C| .  30.   Here   F ( {> |> } ) =   |   i   +   {   j   +   {|}   k . Then using the notation of Exercise 29 ,   CS@C}   = 0   while   CU@C{   =   |} . Since these aren’t equal,   F   is not conservative. Thus by Theorem 4, the line integral of   F   is not independent of path.  31.   G   =   { ( {> | )   |   0   ? | ?   3 }   consists of those points between, but not on, the horizontal lines   |   = 0   and   |   = 3 . (a) Since   G   does not include any of its boundary points, it is open. More formally, at any point in   G   there is a disk centered at that point that lies entirely in   G . (b) Any two points chosen in   G   can always be joined by a path that lies entirely in   G , so   G   is connected. ( G   consists of just one “piece.”)  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Since   F   is a simple closed path which doesn’t pass through or enclose the origin, there exists an open region that doesn’t contain the origin but does contain   G . Thus   S   =   3 |@ ( { 2   +   | 2 )   and   T   =   {@ ( { 2   +   | 2 )   have continuous partial derivatives on this open region containing   G   and we can apply Green’s Theorem.

We express   G   as a type II region:   G   =   { ( {> | )   |   i 1 ( | )   $   {   $   i 2 ( | ) ,   f   $   |   $   g }   where   i 1   and   i 2   are continuous functions.

But referring to the   fi gure,   K  F   T g|   =   K  F 1   +   F 2   +   F 3   +   F 4  T g| . Then   U  F 1   T g|   =   U   f g   T ( i 1 ( | ) > | )   g| ,   U  F 2   T g|   =   U  F 4   T g|   = 0 , and   U  F 3   T g|   =   U   g f   T ( i 2 ( | ) > | )   g| . Hence  K  F   T g|   =   U   g f   [ T ( i 2 ( | ) > | )   3   T ( i 1 ( | ) > | ) ]   g|   =   UU  G   ( CT@C{ )   gD .  31.

For any continuous function   i   on   R 3 , de fi ne a vector   fi eld   G ( {> |> } ) =   h j ( {> |> } ) >   0 >   0 i   where   j ( {> |> } ) =   U   {  0   i   ( w> |> } )   gw . Then   div   G   =   C C{   ( j ( {> |> } )) +   C C|   (0) +   C C}   (0) =   C C{  U   {  0   i   ( w> |> } )   gw   =   i   ( {> |> } )   by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Thus every continuous function   i   on   R 3   is the divergence of some vector   fi eld.  16.6   Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas 1.   S   (7 >   10 >   4)   lies on the parametric surface   r ( x> y ) =   h 2 x   + 3 y>   1 + 5 x   3   y>   2 +   x   +   y i   if and only if there are values for   x  and   y   where   2 x   + 3 y   = 7 ,   1 + 5 x   3   y   = 10 , and   2 +   x   +   y   = 4 . But solving the   fi rst two equations simultaneously gives  x   = 2 ,   y   = 1   and these values do not satisfy the third equation, so   S   does not lie on the surface.  T (5 >   22 >   5)   lies on the surface if   2 x   + 3 y   = 5 ,   1 + 5 x   3   y   = 22 , and   2 +   x   +   y   = 5   for some values of   x   and   y . Solving the  fi rst two equations simultaneously gives   x   = 4 ,   y   =   3 1   and these values satisfy the third equation, so   T   lies on the surface.  2.   S   (3 >   3 1 >   5)   lies on the parametric surface   r ( x> y ) =   x   +   y> x 2   3   y> x   +   y 2    if and only if there are values for   x   and   y  where   x   +   y   = 3 ,   x 2   3   y   =   3 1 , and   x   +   y 2   = 5 . From the   fi rst equation we have   y   = 3   3   x   and substituting into the second equation gives   x 2   3   3 +   x   =   3 1   C   x 2   +   x   3   2 = 0   C   ( x   + 2)( x   3   1) = 0 , so   x   =   3 2   i  y   = 5   or   x   = 1   i   y   = 2 . The third equation is satisi fi ed by   x   = 1 ,   y   = 2   so   S   does lie on the surface.  T ( 3 1 >   3 >   4)   lies on   r ( x> y )   if and only if   x   +   y   =   3 1 ,   x 2   3   y   = 3 , and   x   +   y 2   = 4 , but substituting the   fi rst equation into the second gives   x   =   3 2 ,   y   = 1   or   x   = 1 ,   y   =   3 2 , and neither of these pairs satis fi es the third equation. Thus,   T   does not lie on the surface.  3.   r ( x> y ) = ( x   +   y )   i   + (3   3   y )   j   + (1 + 4 x   + 5 y )   k   =   h 0 >   3 >   1 i   +   x   h 1 >   0 >   4 i   +   y   h 1 >   3 1 >   5 i . From Example 3, we recognize this as a vector equation of a plane through the point   (0 >   3 >   1)   and containing vectors   a   =   h 1 >   0 >   4 i   and   b   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   5 i . If we wish to   fi nd a more conventional equation for the plane, a normal vector to the plane is   a   ×   b   =          i   j   k  1   0   4 1   3 1   5          = 4   i   3   j   3   k  and an equation of the plane is   4( {   3   0)   3   ( |   3   3)   3   ( }   3   1) = 0   or   4 {   3   |   3   }   =   3 4 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

For any point   ( {> |> } )   on the surface, we have   ( {@ 2) 2   + ( |@ 3) 2   = sin 2   x   + cos 2   x   = 1 , so cross-sections parallel to the   |} -plane are all ellipses. Since   }   =   y   with   0   $   y   $   2 , the surface is the portion of the elliptical cylinder   { 2 @ 4 +   | 2 @ 9 = 1  for   0   $   }   $   2 .  5.   r ( v> w ) =   v> w> w 2   3   v 2  , so the corresponding parametric equations for the surface are   {   =   v ,   |   =   w ,   }   =   w 2   3   v 2 . For any point   ( {> |> } )   on the surface, we have   }   =   | 2   3   { 2 . With no restrictions on the parameters, the surface is   }   =   | 2   3   { 2 , which we recognize as a hyperbolic paraboloid.  6.   r ( v> w ) =   v   sin 2 w   i   +   v 2   j   +   v   cos 2 w   k , so the corresponding parametric equations for the surface are   {   =   v   sin 2 w ,   |   =   v 2 ,  }   =   v   cos 2 w . For any point   ( {> |> } )   on the surface, we have   { 2   +   } 2   =   v 2   sin 2   2 w   +   v 2   cos 2   2 w   =   v 2   =   | . Since no restrictions are placed on the parameters, the surface is   |   =   { 2   +   } 2 , which we recognize as a circular paraboloid whose axis is the   | -axis.  7.   r ( x> y ) =   x 2 > y 2 > x   +   y  ,   3 1   $   x   $   1 ,   3 1   $   y   $   1 .

In Maple, the surface can be graphed by entering  plot3d([uˆ2,vˆ2,u+v],u=-1..1,v=-1..1); . In Mathematica we use the   ParametricPlot3D   command. If we keep   x   constant at   x 0 ,   {   =   x 2 0 , a constant, so the corresponding grid curves must be the curves parallel to the  |} -plane. If   y   is constant, we have   |   =   y 2 0   , a constant, so these grid curves are the curves parallel to the   {} -plane.  8.   r ( x> y ) =   x> y 3 >   3 y  ,   3 2   $   x   $   2 ,   3 2   $   y   $   2 .

If   x   =   x 0   is constant,  {   =   x 0   =   constant, so the corresponding grid curves are the curves parallel to the   |} -plane. If   y   =   y 0   is constant,   |   =   y 3 0   =   constant, so the corresponding grid curves are the curves parallel to the  {} -plane.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

Then  |   = (tan   y 0 ) { , so these are the grid curves we see that lie in vertical planes   |   =   n{   through the   } -axis.  10.   r ( x> y ) =   h x>   sin( x   +   y ) >   sin   y i ,   3    $   x   $    ,   3    $   y   $    .

If   x   =   x 0   is constant,  {   =   x 0   =   constant, so the corresponding grid curves are the curves parallel to the   |} -plane.

If   x   =   x 0   is constant, then   {   = sin   x 0   =   constant, so the corresponding grid curves are the curves parallel to the   |} -plane. If  y   =   y 0   is constant, then   }   = sin   y 0   =   constant, so the corresponding grid curves are the curves parallel to the   {| -plane.  13.   r ( x> y ) =   x   cos   y   i   +   x   sin   y   j   +   y   k . The parametric equations for the surface are   {   =   x   cos   y ,   |   =   x   sin   y ,   }   =   y . We look at the grid curves   fi rst; if we   fi x   y , then   {   and   |   parametrize a straight line in the plane   }   =   y   which intersects the   } -axis. If   x   is held constant, the projection onto the   {| -plane is circular; with   }   =   y , each grid curve is a helix. The surface is a spiraling ramp, graph IV.  14.   r ( x> y ) =   x   cos   y   i   +   x   sin   y   j   + sin   x   k . The corresponding parametric equations for the surface are   {   =   x   cos   y ,   |   =   x   sin   y ,  }   = sin   x ,   3    $   x   $    . If   x   =   x 0   is held constant, then   {   =   x 0   cos   y ,   |   =   x 0   sin   y   so each grid curve is a circle of radius  | x 0 |   in the horizontal plane   }   = sin   x 0 . If   y   =   y 0   is constant, then   {   =   x   cos   y 0 ,   |   =   x   sin   y 0   i   |   = (tan   y 0 ) { , so the grid curves lie in vertical planes   |   =   n{   through the   } -axis. In fact, since   {   and   |   are constant multiples of   x   and   }   = sin   x , each of these traces is a sine wave. The surface is graph I.  15.   r ( x> y ) = sin   y   i   + cos   x   sin 2 y   j   + sin   x   sin 2 y   k . Parametric equations for the surface are   {   = sin   y ,   |   = cos   x   sin 2 y ,  }   = sin   x   sin 2 y . If   y   =   y 0   is   fi xed, then   {   = sin   y 0   is constant, and   |   = (sin 2 y 0 ) cos   x   and   }   = (sin 2 y 0 ) sin   x   describe a circle of radius   | sin 2 y 0 | , so each corresponding grid curve is a circle contained in the vertical plane   {   = sin   y 0   parallel to the  |} -plane. The only possible surface is graph II. The grid curves we see running lengthwise along the surface correspond to holding   x   constant, in which case   |   = (cos   x 0 ) sin 2 y ,   }   = (sin   x 0 ) sin 2 y   i   }   = (tan   x 0 ) | , so each grid curve lies in a plane   }   =   n|   that includes the   { -axis.  16.   {   = (1   3   x )(3 + cos   y ) cos 4 x ,   |   = (1   3   x )(3 + cos   y ) sin 4 x ,   }   = 3 x   + (1   3   x ) sin   y . These equations correspond to graph V: when   x   = 0 , then   {   = 3 + cos   y ,   |   = 0 , and   }   = sin   y , which are equations of a circle with radius   1   in the   {} -plane centered at   (3 >   0 >   0) . When   x   =   1 2   , then   {   =   3 2   +   1 2   cos   y ,   |   = 0 , and   }   =   3 2   +   1 2   sin   y , which are equations of a circle with radius   1 2   in the   {} -plane centered at      3 2   >   0 >   3 2   . When   x   = 1 , then   {   =   |   = 0   and   }   = 3 , giving the topmost point shown in the graph. This suggests that the grid curves with   x   constant are the vertically oriented circles visible on the surface. The spiralling grid curves correspond to keeping   y   constant.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

If   y   =   y 0   is held constant then   }   = sin 3   y 0   is constant, so the corresponding grid curve lies in a horizontal plane. Several of the graphs exhibit horizontal grid curves, but the curves for this surface are neither circles nor straight lines, so graph III is the only possibility. (In fact, the horizontal grid curves here are members of the family   {   =   d   cos 3   x ,   |   =   d   sin 3   x   and are called astroids.) The vertical grid curves we see on the surface correspond to   x   =   x 0   held constant, as then we have   {   = cos 3   x 0   cos 3   y ,   |   = sin 3   x 0   cos 3   y   so the corresponding grid curve lies in the vertical plane   |   = (tan 3   x 0 ) {   through the   } -axis.  18.   {   = (1   3   | x | ) cos   y ,   |   = (1   3   | x | ) sin   y ,   }   =   x . Then   { 2   +   | 2   = (1   3   | x | ) 2   cos 2   y   + (1   3   | x | ) 2   sin 2   y   = (1   3   | x | ) 2 , so if   x  is held constant, each grid curve is a circle of radius   (1   3   | x | )   in the horizontal plane   }   =   x . The graph then must be graph VI. If   y   is held constant, so   y   =   y 0 , we have   {   = (1   3   | x | ) cos   y 0   and   |   = (1   3   | x | ) sin   y 0 . Then   |   = (tan   y 0 ) { , so the grid curves we see running vertically along the surface in the planes   |   =   n{   correspond to keeping   y   constant.  19.   From Example 3, parametric equations for the plane through the point   (0 >   0 >   0)   that contains the vectors   a   =   h 1 >   3 1 >   0 i   and  b   =   h 0 >   1 >   3 1 i   are   {   = 0 +   x (1) +   y (0) =   x ,   |   = 0 +   x ( 3 1) +   y (1) =   y   3   x ,   }   = 0 +   x (0) +   y ( 3 1) =   3 y .  20.   From Example 3, parametric equations for the plane through the point   (0 >   3 1 >   5)   that contains the vectors   a   =   h 2 >   1 >   4 i   and  b   =   h 3 3 >   2 >   5 i   are   {   = 0 +   x (2) +   y ( 3 3) = 2 x   3   3 y ,   |   =   3 1 +   x (1) +   y (2) =   3 1 +   x   + 2 y ,  }   = 5 +   x (4) +   y (5) = 5 + 4 x   + 5 y .  21.   Solving the equation for   {   gives   { 2   = 1 +   | 2   +   1 4   } 2   i   {   =  t  1 +   | 2   +   1 4   } 2 . (We choose the positive root since we want the part of the hyperboloid that corresponds to   {   D   0 .) If we let   |   and   }   be the parameters, parametric equations are   |   =   | ,  }   =   } ,   {   =  t  1 +   | 2   +   1 4   } 2 .  22.   Solving the equation for   |   gives   | 2   =   1 2   (1   3   { 2   3   3 } 2 )   i   |   =   3  t   1 2   (1   3   { 2   3   3 } 2 )   (since we want the part of the ellipsoid that corresponds to   |   $   0 ). If we let   {   and   }   be the parameters, parametric equations are   {   =   { ,   }   =   } ,  |   =   3  t   1 2   (1   3   { 2   3   3 } 2 ) .  Alternate solution : The equation can be rewritten as   { 2   +   | 2   1 @ I 2    2   +   } 2  (1 @ I 3) 2   = 1 , and if we let   {   =   x   cos   y   and  }   =   1  I 3   x   sin   y , then   |   =   3  t   1 2   (1   3   { 2   3   3 } 2 ) =   3  t   1 2   (1   3   x 2   cos 2   y   3   x 2   sin 2   y ) =   3  t   1 2   (1   3   x 2 ) , where   0   $   x   $   1  and   0   $   y   $   2  .

Since the cone intersects the sphere in the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 2 ,   }   =   I 2   and we want the portion of the sphere above this, we can parametrize the surface as   {   =   { ,   |   =   | ,   }   =   s 4   3   { 2   3   | 2   where   { 2   +   | 2   $   2 .  Alternate solution:   Using spherical coordinates,   {   = 2 sin   !   cos    ,   |   = 2 sin   !   sin    ,   }   = 2 cos   !   where   0   $   !   $     4   and  0   $      $   2  .  24.   In spherical coordinates, parametric equations are   {   = 4 sin   !   cos    ,   |   = 4 sin   !   sin    ,   }   = 4 cos   ! . The intersection of the sphere with the plane   }   = 2   corresponds to   }   = 4 cos   !   = 2   i   cos   !   =   1 2   i   !   =     3   . By symmetry, the intersection of the sphere with the plane   }   =   3 2   corresponds to   !   =      3     3   =   2   3   . Thus the surface is described by   0   $      $   2  ,    3   $   !   $   2   3   .  25.   Parametric equations are   {   =   { ,   |   = 4 cos    ,   }   = 4 sin    ,   0   $   {   $   5 ,   0   $      $   2  .  26.   Using   {   and   |   as the parameters,   {   =   { ,   |   =   | ,   }   =   {   + 3   where   0   $   { 2   +   | 2   $   1 . Also, since the plane intersects the cylinder in an ellipse, the surface is a planar ellipse in the plane   }   =   {   + 3 . Thus, parametrizing with respect to   v   and    , we have   {   =   v   cos    ,   |   =   v   sin    ,   }   = 3 +   v   cos      where   0   $   v   $   1   and   0   $      $   2  .  27.   The surface appears to be a portion of a circular cylinder of radius   3   with axis the   { -axis. An equation of the cylinder is  | 2   +   } 2   = 9 , and we can impose the restrictions   0   $   {   $   5 ,   |   $   0   to obtain the portion shown. To graph the surface on a CAS, we can use parametric equations   {   =   x ,   |   = 3 cos   y ,   }   = 3 sin   y   with the parameter domain   0   $   x   $   5 ,     2   $   y   $   3   2   . Alternatively, we can regard   {   and   }   as parameters. Then parametric equations are   {   =   { ,   }   =   } ,   |   =   3 I 9   3   } 2 , where  0   $   {   $   5   and   3 3   $   }   $   3 .  28.   The surface appears to be a portion of a sphere of radius   1   centered at the origin. In spherical coordinates, the sphere has equation      = 1 , and imposing the restrictions     2   $      $   2  ,     4   $   !   $      will give only the portion of the sphere shown. Thus, to graph the surface on a CAS we can either use spherical coordinates with the stated restrictions, or we can use parametric equations:   {   = sin   !   cos    ,   |   = sin   !   sin    ,   }   = cos   ! ,     2   $      $   2  ,     4   $   !   $    .  29.   Using Equations 3, we have the parametrization   {   =   { ,   |   =   h 3 {   cos    ,  }   =   h 3 {   sin    ,   0   $   {   $   3 ,   0   $      $   2  .  30.   Letting      be the angle of rotation about the   | -axis, we have the parametrization   {   = (4 | 2   3   | 4 ) cos    ,   |   =   | ,   }   = (4 | 2   3   | 4 ) sin    ,  3 2   $   |   $   2 ,   0   $      $   2  .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(a) Replacing   cos   x   by   sin   x   and   sin   x   by   cos   x   gives parametric equations  {   = (2 + sin   y ) sin   x ,   |   = (2 + sin   y ) cos   x ,   }   =   x   + cos   y . From the graph, it appears that the direction of the spiral is reversed. We can verify this observation by noting that the projection of the spiral grid curves onto the   {| -plane, given by  {   = (2 + sin   y ) sin   x ,   |   = (2 + sin   y ) cos   x ,   }   = 0 , draws a circle in the clockwise direction for each value of   y . The original equations, on the other hand, give circular projections drawn in the counterclockwise direction. The equation for   }   is identical in both surfaces, so as   }   increases, these grid curves spiral up in opposite directions for the two surfaces. (b) Replacing   cos   x   by   cos 2 x   and   sin   x   by   sin 2 x   gives parametric equations  {   = (2 + sin   y ) cos 2 x ,   |   = (2 + sin   y ) sin 2 x ,   }   =   x   + cos   y . From the graph, it appears that the number of coils in the surface doubles within the same parametric domain. We can verify this observation by noting that the projection of the spiral grid curves onto the   {| -plane, given by   {   = (2 + sin   y ) cos 2 x ,   |   = (2 + sin   y ) sin 2 x ,  }   = 0   (where   y   is constant), complete circular revolutions for   0   $   x   $      while the original surface requires   0   $   x   $   2    for a complete revolution. Thus, the new surface winds around twice as fast as the original surface, and since the equation for   }  is identical in both surfaces, we observe twice as many circular coils in the same  } -interval.  32.   First we graph the surface as viewed from the front, then from two additional viewpoints. The surface appears as a twisted sheet, and is unusual because it has only one side. (The Möbius strip is discussed in more detail in Section 16.7.)  33.   r ( x> y ) = ( x   +   y )   i   + 3 x 2   j   + ( x   3   y )   k .  r x   =   i   + 6 x   j   +   k   and   r y   =   i   3   k , so   r x   ×   r y   =   3 6 x   i   + 2   j   3   6 x   k . Since the point   (2 >   3 >   0)   corresponds to   x   = 1 ,   y   = 1 , a normal vector to the surface at   (2 >   3 >   0)   is   3 6   i   + 2   j   3   6   k , and an equation of the tangent plane is   3 6 {   + 2 |   3   6 }   =   3 6   or  3 {   3   |   + 3 }   = 3 .  34.   r ( x> y ) = ( x 2   + 1)   i   + ( y 3   + 1)   j   + ( x   +   y )   k .  r x   = 2 x   i   +   k   and   r y   = 3 y 2   j   +   k , so   r x   ×   r y   =   3 3 y 2   i   3   2 x   j   + 6 xy 2   k . Since the point   (5 >   2 >   3)   corresponds to   x   = 2 ,  y   = 1 , a normal vector to the surface at   (5 >   2 >   3)   is   3 3   i   3   4   j   + 12   k , and an equation of the tangent plane is  3 3( {   3   5)   3   4( |   3   2) + 12( }   3   3) = 0   or   3 {   + 4 |   3   12 }   =   3 13 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

(2)   In the alternate solution, you can avoid having to use   | sin    |   by working in the   fi rst octant and then multiplying by   4 . However, if you set up   V 1   as above and arrived at   D ( V 1 ) =   d 2  , you now see your error.  64.   (a) Here   }   =   d   sin    ,   |   =   | DE | , and   {   =   | RD | . But  | RE |   =   | RF |   +   | FE |   =   e   +   d   cos      and   sin      =   | DE | | RE |   so that  |   =   | RE |   sin      = ( e   +   d   cos    ) sin    . Similarly   cos      =   | RD | | RE |   so  {   = ( e   +   d   cos    ) cos    .

Both   K   and   S   are oriented piecewise-smooth surfaces that are bounded by the simple, closed, smooth curve   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 ,  }   = 0   (which we can take to be oriented positively for both surfaces). Then   K   and   S   satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes’ Theorem, so by (3) we know   UU  K   curl   F   ·   g S   =   U  F   F   ·   g r   =   UU  S   curl   F   ·   g S   (where   F   is the boundary curve).  2.   The boundary curve   F   is the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 9 ,   }   = 0   oriented in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above. A vector equation of   F   is   r ( w ) = 3 cos   w   i   + 3 sin   w   j ,   0   $   w   $   2  , so   r 0 ( w ) =   3 3 sin   w   i   + 3 cos   w   j   and  F ( r ( w )) = 2(3 sin   w )(cos 0)   i   +   h 3 cos   w (sin 0)   j   + (3 cos   w ) h 3 sin   w   k   = 6 sin   w   i   + (3 cos   w ) h 3 sin   w   k . Then, by Stokes’ Theorem,  UU  V   curl   F   ·   g S   =   U  F   F   ·   g r   =   U   2   0   F ( r ( w ))   ·   r 0 ( w )   gw   =   U   2   0   ( 3 18 sin 2   w   + 0 + 0)   gw   =   3 18    1 2   w   3   1 4   sin 2 w  2   0   =   3 18  .  3.   The paraboloid   }   =   { 2   +   | 2   intersects the cylinder   { 2   +   | 2   = 4   in the circle   { 2   +   | 2   = 4 ,   }   = 4 . This boundary curve   F  should be oriented in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above, so a vector equation of   F   is  r ( w ) = 2 cos   w   i   + 2 sin   w   j   + 4   k ,   0   $   w   $   2  .

F   is the square in the plane   }   =   3 1 .

For   V 2 , we choose   n   =   k   so that   F   has the same orientation for both surfaces. Then   curl   F   ·   n   =   |   3   {}   =   {   +   |   on   V 2 , where   }   =   3 1 . Thus   UU  V 2   curl   F   ·   g S   =   U   1  3 1  U   1  3 1 ( {   +   | )   g{ g|   = 0  so   UU  V 1   curl   F   ·   g S   = 0 .  6.   The boundary curve   F   is the circle   { 2   +   } 2   = 1 ,   |   = 0   which should be oriented in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from the right, so a vector equation of   F   is   r ( w ) = cos( 3 w )   i   + sin( 3 w )   k   = cos   w   i   3   sin   w   k ,   0   $   w   $   2  .

Then the projection of   V   onto the   {| -plane is the unit disk   G   [ { 2   +   | 2   $   1 ].   F   is traversed clockwise (when viewed from above) so   V   is oriented downward.

But   F 1   is the circle   { 2   +   | 2   =   d 2   oriented in the counterclockwise direction while   F 2   is the same circle oriented in the clockwise direction. Hence   K  F 2   F   ·   g r   =   3 K  F 1   F   ·   g r   so   UU  V   curl   F   ·   g S   = 0   as desired.  20.

(b) As in (a),   curl( i   Q i ) =   Q i   ×   Q i   =   0 , so by Stokes’ Theorem,   U  F   ( i   Q i   )   ·   g r   =   UU  V   [curl( i   Q i   )]   ·   g S   = 0 . (c) As in part (a),  curl( i   Q j   +   j Q i ) = curl( i   Q j ) + curl( j Q i   )   [by Exercise 16.5.24]  = ( Q i   ×   Q j ) + ( Q j   ×   Q i ) =   0   [since   u   ×   v   =   3 ( v   ×   u ) ] Hence by Stokes’ Theorem,   U  F   ( i   Q j   +   j Q i )   ·   g r   =   UU  V   curl( i   Q j   +   j Q i   )   ·   g S   = 0 .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

By the Divergence Theorem, the   fl ux of   F   across the surface of the cube is  UU  V   F   ·   g S   =   U   @ 2 0  U   @ 2 0  U   @ 2 0   cos   {   cos 2   |   + 3 sin 2   |   cos   |   cos 4   }   + 5 sin 4   }   cos   }   cos 6   {    g} g| g{   =   19 64    2 .  17.   For   V 1   we have   n   =   3 k , so   F   ·   n   =   F   ·   ( 3 k ) =   3 { 2 }   3   | 2   =   3 | 2   (since   }   = 0   on   V 1 ). So if   G   is the unit disk, we get  UU  V 1   F   ·   g S   =   UU  V 1   F   ·   n   gV   =   UU  G   ( 3 | 2 )   gD   =   3   U   2   0  U   1 0   u 2   (sin 2    )   u gu g   =   3   1 4    . Now since   V 2   is closed, we can use the Divergence Theorem. Since   div   F   =   C C{   ( } 2 { ) +   C C|     1 3   | 3   + tan   }    +   C C}   ( { 2 }   +   | 2 ) =   } 2   +   | 2   +   { 2 , we use spherical coordinates to get   UU  V 2   F   ·   g S   =   UUU  H   div   F   gY   =   U   2   0  U   @ 2 0  U   1 0    2   ·    2   sin   ! g g! g   =   2 5    . Finally  UU  V   F   ·   g S   =   UU  V 2   F   ·   g S   3   UU  V 1   F   ·   g S   =   2 5      3    3   1 4       =   13 20    .  18.   As in the hint to Exercise 17, we create a closed surface   V 2   =   V      V 1 , where   V   is the part of the paraboloid   { 2   +   | 2   +   }   = 2  that lies above the plane   }   = 1 , and   V 1   is the disk   { 2   +   | 2   = 1   on the plane   }   = 1   oriented downward, and we then apply the Divergence Theorem. Since the disk   V 1   is oriented downward, its unit normal vector is   n   =   3 k   and   F   ·   ( 3 k ) =   3 }   =   3 1   on  V 1 . So   UU  V 1   F   ·   g S   =   UU  V 1   F   ·   n   gV   =   UU  V 1   ( 3 1)   gV   =   3 D ( V 1 ) =   3  . Let   H   be the region bounded by   V 2 . Then  UU  V 2   F   ·   g S   =   UUU  H   div   F   gY   =   UUU  H   1   gY   =   U   1 0  U   2   0  U   2 3 u 2  1   u g} g gu   =   U   1 0  U   2   0   ( u   3   u 3 )   g gu   = (2  )   1 4   =     2   . Thus the  fl ux of   F   across   V   is   UU  V   F   ·   g S   =   UU  V 2   F   ·   g S   3   UU  V 1   F   ·   g S   =     2   3   ( 3  ) =   3   2   .  19.   The vectors that end near   S 1   are longer than the vectors that start near   S 1 , so the net   fl ow is inward near   S 1   and   div   F ( S 1 )   is negative. The vectors that end near   S 2   are shorter than the vectors that start near   S 2 , so the net   fl ow is outward near   S 2   and  div   F ( S 2 )   is positive.  20.   (a) The vectors that end near   S 1   are shorter than the vectors that start near   S 1 , so the net   fl ow is outward and   S 1   is a source. The vectors that end near   S 2   are longer than the vectors that start near   S 2 , so the net   fl ow is inward and   S 2   is a sink. (b)   F ( {> | ) =   {> | 2    i   div   F   =   Q   ·   F   = 1 + 2 | . The   | -value at   S 1   is positive, so   div   F   = 1 + 2 |   is positive, thus   S 1  is a source. At   S 2 ,   | ?   3 1 , so   div   F   = 1 + 2 |   is negative, and   S 2   is a sink.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

A vector   fi eld can represent, for example, the wind velocity at any location in space, the speed and direction of the ocean current at any location, or the force vectors of Earth’s gravitational   fi eld at a location in space.  2.   (a) A conservative vector   fi eld   F   is a vector   fi eld which is the gradient of some scalar function   i   . (b) The function   i   in part (a) is called a potential function for   F >   that is,   F   =   Q i .  3.   (a) See De fi nition 16.2.2. (b) We normally evaluate the line integral using Formula 16.2.3.

(d) See (5) and (6) in Section 16.2 for plane curves; we have similar de fi nitions when   F   is a space curve [see the equation preceding (10) in Section 16.2]. (e) For plane curves, see Equations 16.2.7. We have similar results for space curves [see the equation preceding (10) in Section 16.2].  4.   (a) See De fi nition 16.2.13.

True, by Theorem 16.5.3 and the fact that   div   0   = 0 .  4.   True, by Theorem 16.3.2.  5.   False. See Exercise 16.3.35. (But the assertion is true if   G   is simply-connected; see Theorem 16.3.6.)  6.   False. See the discussion accompanying Figure 8 on page 1092 [ET 1068].  7.   False. For example,   div( |   i ) = 0 = div( {   j )   but   |   i   6   =   {   j .  8.   True. Line integrals of conservative vector   fi elds are independent of path, and by Theorem 16.3.3, work   =   U  F   F   ·   g r   = 0   for any closed path   F .  9.   True. See Exercise 16.5.24.  10.   False.   F   ·   G   is a scalar   fi eld, so   curl( F   ·   G )   has no meaning.  11.   True. Apply the Divergence Theorem and use the fact that   div   F   = 0 .  12.   False by Theorem 16.5.11, because if it were true, then   div curl   F   = 3   6   = 0 .  1.   (a) Vectors starting on   F   point in roughly the direction opposite to   F , so the tangential component   F   ·   T   is negative. Thus   U  F   F   ·   g r   =   U  F   F   ·   T   gv   is negative. (b) The vectors that end near   S   are shorter than the vectors that start near   S   , so the net   fl ow is outward near   S   and  div   F ( S   )   is positive.  2.

But   i { ( {> | ) = (1 +   {| ) h {|   , so   j 0 ( { ) = 0   i   j ( { ) =   N . Thus   i   ( {> | ) =   h |   +   {h {|   +   N   is a potential function for   F .  12.   F   is de fi ned on all of   R 3 , its components have continuous partial derivatives, and curl   F   = (0   3   0)   i   3   (0   3   0)   j   + (cos   |   3   cos   | )   k   =   0 , so   F   is conservative by Theorem 16.5.4. Thus there exists a function  i   such that   Q i   =   F . Then   i { ( {> |> } ) = sin   |   implies   i ( {> |> } ) =   {   sin   |   +   j ( |> } )   and then  i |   ( {> |> } ) =   {   cos   |   +   j |   ( |> } ) . But   i |   ( {> |> } ) =   {   cos   | , so   j |   ( |> } ) = 0   i   j   ( |> } ) =   k ( } ) . Then  i   ( {> |> } ) =   {   sin   |   +   k ( } )   implies   i }   ( {> |> } ) =   k 0 ( } ) . But   i }   ( {> |> } ) =   3   sin   } , so   k ( } ) = cos   }   +   N . Thus a potential function for   F   is   i ( {> |> } ) =   {   sin   |   + cos   }   +   N .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Q 2 i   = 0   means that   C 2 i C{ 2   +   C 2 i C| 2   = 0 . Now if   F   =   i |   i   3   i {   j   and   F   is any closed path in   G , then applying Green’s Theorem, we get  U  F   F   ·   g r   =   U  F   i |   g{   3   i {   g|   =   UU  G  k   C C{   ( 3 i { )   3   C C|   ( i |   )  l  gD  =   3   UU  G   ( i {{   +   i ||   )   gD   =   3   UU  G   0   gD   = 0  Therefore the line integral is independent of path, by Theorem 16.3.3.  24.   (a)   { 2   +   | 2   = cos 2   w   + sin 2   w   = 1 , so   F   lies on the circular cylinder   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 . But also   |   =   } , so   F   lies on the plane   |   =   } . Thus   F   is the intersection of the plane   |   =   }   and the cylinder   { 2   +   | 2   = 1 .

Here we must use Equation 16.9.7 since   F   is not de fi ned at the origin. Let   V 1   be the sphere of radius   1   with center at the origin and outer unit normal   n 1 . Let   V 2   be the surface of the ellipsoid with outer unit normal   n 2   and let   H   be the solid region between   V 1   and   V 2 .

Because   curl   F   =   0 ,   F   is conservative, so there exists a function   i   such that   Q i   =   F .

If we convert to rectangular coordinates, we arrive at the same pair of equations,   4 { 2   ±   4   I 3   {|   + 4 | 2   = 1 , so the trace is identical to the trace in   }   =   1 2   .

(a) First we place the piston on coordinate axes so the top of the cylinder is at the origin and   { ( w )   D   0   is the distance from the top of the cylinder to the piston at time   w . Let   F 1   be the curve traced out by the piston during one four-stroke cycle, so   F 1  is given by   r ( w ) =   { ( w )   i ,   d   $   w   $   e . (Thus, the curve lies on the positive   { -axis and reverses direction several times.) The force on the piston is   DS   ( w )   i , where   D   is the area of the top of the piston and   S   ( w )   is the pressure in the cylinder at time   w . As in Section 16.2, the work done on the piston is   U  F 1   F   ·   g r   =   U   e d   DS   ( w )   i   ·   { 0 ( w )   i   gw   =   U   e d   DS   ( w )   { 0 ( w )   gw . Here, the volume of the cylinder at time   w   is   Y   ( w ) =   D{ ( w )   i   Y   0 ( w ) =   D{ 0 ( w )   i   U   e d   DS   ( w )   { 0 ( w )   gw   =   U   e d   S   ( w )   Y   0 ( w )   gw . Since the curve   F   in the   S Y   -plane corresponds to the values of   S   and   Y   at time   w ,   d   $   w   $   e , we have  Z   =   U   e d   DS   ( w )   { 0 ( w )   gw   =   U   e d   S   ( w )   Y   0 ( w )   gw   =   U  F   S gY  Another method:   If we divide the time interval   [ d> e ]   into   q   subintervals of equal length   { w , the amount of work done on the piston in the   l th time interval is approximately   DS   ( w l )[ { ( w l )   3   { ( w l 3 1 )] .

(a)   Case 1   (    = 0 ) :   | 00   +   |   = 0   i   | 00   = 0   which has an auxiliary equation   u 2   = 0   i   u   = 0   i   |   =   f 1   +   f 2 {  where   | (0) = 0   and   | ( O ) = 0 . Thus,   0 =   | (0) =   f 1   and   0 =   | ( O ) =   f 2 O   i   f 1   =   f 2   = 0 . Thus   |   = 0 .  Case 2   (  ?   0 ) :   | 00   +   |   = 0   has auxiliary equation   u 2   =   3    i   u   =   ± I 3    [distinct and real since    ?   0 ]   i  |   =   f 1 h I 3 {   +   f 2 h 3 I 3 {   where   | (0) = 0   and   | ( O ) = 0 . Thus   0 =   | (0) =   f 1   +   f 2   ( W ) and  0 =   | ( O ) =   f 1 h I 3 O   +   f 2 h 3 I 3 O   ( † ). Multiplying ( W ) by   h I 3 O   and subtracting ( † ) gives   f 2    h I 3 O   3   h 3 I 3 O    = 0   i   f 2   = 0   and thus   f 1   = 0   from ( W ). Thus   |   = 0   for the cases      = 0   and    ?   0 . (b)   | 00   +   |   = 0   has an auxiliary equation   u 2   +      = 0   i   u   =   ± l   I    i   |   =   f 1   cos   I  {   +   f 2   sin   I  {   where  | (0) = 0   and   | ( O ) = 0 . Thus,   0 =   | (0) =   f 1   and   0 =   | ( O ) =   f 2   sin   I O   since   f 1   = 0 . Since we cannot have a trivial solution,   f 2   6   = 0   and thus   sin   I  O   = 0   i   I  O   =   q   where   q   is an integer   i      =   q 2  2 @O 2   and  |   =   f 2   sin( q{@O )   where   q   is an integer.  34.   The auxiliary equation is   du 2   +   eu   +   f   = 0 . If   e 2   3   4 df A   0 , then any solution is of the form   | ( { ) =   f 1 h u 1 {   +   f 2 h u 2 {   where  u 1   =   3 e   +   I e 2   3   4 df  2 d   and   u 2   =   3 e   3  I e 2   3   4 df  2 d   . But   d ,   e , and   f   are all positive so both   u 1   and   u 2   are negative and  lim { <"   | ( { ) = 0 . If   e 2   3   4 df   = 0 , then any solution is of the form   | ( { ) =   f 1 h u{   +   f 2 {h u{   where   u   =   3 e@   (2 d )   ?   0  since   d ,   e   are positive. Hence   lim { <"   | ( { ) = 0 . Finally if   e 2   3   4 df ?   0 , then any solution is of the form  | ( { ) =   h { ( f 1   cos   {   +   f 2   sin   { )   where      =   3 e@ (2 d )   ?   0   since   d   and   e   are positive. Thus   lim { <"   | ( { ) = 0 .  35.   (a)   u 2   3   2 u   + 2 = 0   i   u   = 1   ±   l   and the general solution is   |   =   h {   ( f 1   cos   {   +   f 2   sin   { ) . If   | ( d ) =   f   and   | ( e ) =   g   then  h d   ( f 1   cos   d   +   f 2   sin   d ) =   f   i   f 1   cos   d   +   f 2   sin   d   =   fh 3 d   and   h e   ( f 1   cos   e   +   f 2   sin   e ) =   g   i  f 1   cos   e   +   f 2   sin   e   =   gh 3 e . This gives a linear system in   f 1   and   f 2   which has a unique solution if the lines are not parallel. If the lines are not vertical or horizontal, we have parallel lines if   cos   d   =   n   cos   e   and   sin   d   =   n   sin   e   for some nonzero constant   n   or   cos   d  cos   e   =   n   =  sin   d  sin   e   i   sin   d  cos   d   =  sin   e  cos   e   i   tan   d   = tan   e   i   e   3   d   =   q ,   q   any integer. (Note that none of   cos   d ,   cos   e ,   sin   d ,   sin   e   are zero.) If the lines are both horizontal then   cos   d   = cos   e   = 0   i   e   3   d   =   q , and similarly vertical lines means   sin   d   = sin   e   = 0   i   e   3   d   =   q . Thus the system has a unique solution if   e   3   d   6   =   q . (b) The linear system has no solution if the lines are parallel but not identical. From part (a) the lines are parallel if  e   3   d   =   q . If the lines are not horizontal, they are identical if   fh 3 d   =   ngh 3 e   i   fh 3 d  gh 3 e   =   n   =  cos   d  cos   e   i  f g   =   h d 3 e   cos   d  cos   e   . (If   g   = 0   then   f   = 0   also.) If they are horizontal then   cos   e   = 0 , but   n   =  sin   d  sin   e   also (and   sin   e   6   = 0 ) so we require   f g   =   h d 3 e   sin   d  sin   e   . Thus the system has no solution if   e   3   d   =   q   and   f g   6   =   h d 3 e   cos   d  cos   e   unless   cos   e   = 0 , in which case   f g   6   =   h d 3 e   sin   d  sin   e   .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

The auxiliary equation is   u 2   3   1 = 0   with roots   u   =   ± 1 , so the complementary solution is   | f ( { ) =   f 1 h {   +   f 2 h 3 { . We try the particular solution   | s ( { ) =   D{ 3   +   E{ 2   +   F{   +   G , so   | 0  s   = 3 D{ 2   + 2 E{   +   F   and   | 00  s   = 6 D{   + 2 E .

Comparing coef fi cients gives   3 D   = 1   i   D   =   3 1 ,  3 E   = 0   i   E   = 0 ,   6 D   3   F   =   3 1   i   F   =   3 5 , and   2 E   3   G   = 0   i   G   = 0 , so the general solution is  | ( { ) =   | f ( { ) +   | s ( { ) =   f 1 h {   +   f 2 h 3 {   3   { 3   3   5 { .  3.

The auxiliary equation is   u 2   + 2 u   + 5 = 0   with roots   u   =   3 1   ±   2 l , so the complementary solution is  | f ( { ) =   h 3 { ( f 1   cos 2 {   +   f 2   sin 2 { ) .

The auxiliary equation is   5 u 2   + 100 = 0   with roots   u   =   ± 2   I 5   l , so the general solution to the differential equation is  { ( w ) =   f 1   cos  2   I 5   w    +   f 2   sin  2   I 5   w  .

By Hooke’s Law   n (0 = 4) = 32   so   n   =   32 0 = 4   = 80   is the spring constant and the differential equation is   8 { 00   + 80 {   = 0 . The general solution is   { ( w ) =   f 1   cos  I 10   w    +   f 2   sin  I 10   w  .

If   f   = 10 , we have two complex roots   u   =   3 5   ±   5   I 3   l , so the motion is underdamped and the solution is  {   =   h 3 5 w  f 1   cos  5   I 3   w    +   f 2   sin  5   I 3   w  .

For   f   = 20 , we have equal roots   u 1   =   u 2   =   3 10 , so the oscillation is critically damped and the solution is  {   = ( f 1   +   f 2 w ) h 3 10 w .

If   f   = 25   the auxiliary equation has roots   u 1   =   3 5 ,   u 2   =   3 20 , so we have overdamping and the solution is  {   =   f 1 h 3 5 w   +   f 2 h 3 20 w .

If   f   = 30   we have roots   u   =   3 15   ±   5   I 5 , so the motion is overdamped and the solution is   {   =   f 1 h ( 3 15 + 5   I 5   ) w   +   f 2 h ( 3 15   3   5   I 5   ) w .

Entering the initial conditions gives   f 1   =   1 2   I 15   and   f 2   =   3   1 2   I 15   , so  {   =   1 2   I 15   h ( 3 5 +   I 15   ) w   3   1 2   I 15   h ( 3 5   3  I 15   ) w .  n   = 20 :   u   =   3 5   ±   I 5   and the solution is   {   =   f 1 h ( 3 5 +   I 5   ) w   +   f 2 h ( 3 5   3  I 5   ) w   so again the motion is overdamped. The initial conditions give   f 1   =   1 2   I 5   and   f 2   =   3   1 2   I 5   , so   {   =   1 2   I 5   h ( 3 5 +   I 5   ) w   3   1 2   I 5   h ( 3 5   3  I 5   ) w .  n   = 25 : we have equal roots   u 1   =   u 2   =   3 5 , so the motion is critically damped and the solution is   {   = ( f 1   +   f 2 w ) h 3 5 w . The initial conditions give   f 1   = 0   and   f 2   = 1 , so   {   =   wh 3 5 w .  n   = 30 :   u   =   3 5   ±   I 5   l   so the motion is underdamped and the solution is   {   =   h 3 5 w  f 1   cos  I 5   w    +   f 2   sin  I 5   w  . The initial conditions give   f 1   = 0   and   f 2   =   1 I 5   , so   {   =   1 I 5   h 3 5 w   sin  I 5   w  .  n   = 40 :   u   =   3 5   ±   I 15   l   so we again have underdamping. The solution is   {   =   h 3 5 w  f 1   cos  I 15   w    +   f 2   sin  I 15   w  , and the initial conditions give   f 1   = 0   and   f 2   =   1 I 15   . Thus   {   =   1 I 15   h 3 5 w   sin  I 15   w  .  9.   The differential equation is   p{ 00   +   n{   =   I 0   cos   $ 0 w   and   $ 0   6   =   $   =   s n@p . Here the auxiliary equation is   pu 2   +   n   = 0  with roots   ± s n@p l   =   ± $l   so   { f ( w ) =   f 1   cos   $w   +   f 2   sin   $w . Since   $ 0   6   =   $ , try   { s ( w ) =   D   cos   $ 0 w   +   E   sin   $ 0 w . Then we need   ( p )  3 $ 2 0   ( D   cos   $ 0 w   +   E   sin   $ 0 w ) +   n ( D   cos   $ 0 w   +   E   sin   $ 0 w ) =   I 0   cos   $ 0 w   or   D  n   3   p$ 2 0     =   I 0   and  E  n   3   p$ 2 0     = 0 . Hence   E   = 0   and   D   =   I 0  n   3   p$ 2 0  =   I 0  p ( $ 2   3   $ 2 0 )   since   $ 2   =   n p   . Thus the motion of the mass is given by   { ( w ) =   f 1   cos   $w   +   f 2   sin   $w   +   I 0  p ( $ 2   3   $ 2 0 )  cos   $ 0 w .  10.   As in Exercise 9,   { f ( w ) =   f 1   cos   $w   +   f 2   sin   $w . But the natural frequency of the system equals the frequency of the external force, so try   { s ( w ) =   w ( D   cos   $w   +   E   sin   $w ) . Then we need  p (2 $E   3   $ 2 Dw ) cos   $w   3   p (2 $D   +   $ 2 Ew ) sin   $w   +   nDw   cos   $w   +   nEw   sin   $w   =   I 0   cos   $w   or   2 p$E   =   I 0   and  3 2 p$D   = 0   [noting   3 p$ 2 D   +   nD   = 0   and   3 p$ 2 E   +   nE   = 0   since   $ 2   =   n@p ]. Hence the general solution is  { ( w ) =   f 1   cos   $w   +   f 2   sin   $w   + [ I 0 w@ (2 p$ )] sin   $w .  11.   From Equation 6,   { ( w ) =   i   ( w ) +   j ( w )   where   i   ( w ) =   f 1   cos   $w   +   f 2   sin   $w   and   j ( w ) =   I 0  p ( $ 2   3   $ 2 0 )  cos   $ 0 w . Then   i  is periodic, with period   2  $   , and if   $   6   =   $ 0 ,   j   is periodic with period   2  $ 0   . If   $ $ 0   is a rational number, then we can say  $ $ 0   =   d e   i   d   =   e$ $ 0   where   d   and   e   are non-zero integers. Then  {  w   +   d   ·   2  $     =   i    w   +   d   ·   2  $     +   j  w   +   d   ·   2  $     =   i   ( w ) +   j    w   +   e$ $ 0   ·   2  $    =   i   ( w ) +   j    w   +   e   ·   2  $ 0    =   i   ( w ) +   j ( w ) =   { ( w )  so   { ( w )   is periodic.  c °   2012 Cengage Learning.

Since   w A   0 ,   {   has a   w -intercept if and only if   f 1   and   f 2   have opposite signs. (b) For   w A   0 , the graph of   {   crosses the   w -axis when   f 1 h u 1 w   +   f 2 h u 2 w   = 0   C   f 2 h u 2 w   =   3 f 1 h u 1 w   C  f 2   =   3 f 1  h u 1 w  h u 2 w   =   3 f 1 h ( u 1 3 u 2 ) w . But   u 1   A u 2   i   u 1   3   u 2   A   0   and since   w A   0 ,   h ( u 1 3 u 2 ) w   A   1 . Thus  | f 2 |   =   | f 1 |   h ( u 1 3 u 2 ) w   A   | f 1 | , and the graph of   {   can cross the   w -axis only if   | f 2 |   A   | f 1 | .  13.   Here the initial-value problem for the charge is   T 00   + 20 T 0   + 500 T   = 12 ,   T (0) =   T 0 (0) = 0 . Then  T f ( w ) =   h 3 10 w ( f 1   cos 20 w   +   f 2   sin 20 w )   and try   T s   ( w ) =   D   i   500 D   = 12   or   D   =   3 125   . The general solution is   T ( w ) =   h 3 10 w ( f 1   cos 20 w   +   f 2   sin 20 w ) +   3 125   . But   0 =   T (0) =   f 1   +   3 125   and  T 0 ( w ) =   L ( w ) =   h 3 10 w [( 3 10 f 1   + 20 f 2 ) cos 20 w   + ( 3 10 f 2   3   20 f 1 ) sin 20 w ]   but   0 =   T 0 (0) =   3 10 f 1   + 20 f 2 . Thus the charge is   T ( w ) =   3   1 250   h 3 10 w (6 cos 20 w   + 3 sin 20 w ) +   3 125   and the current is   L ( w ) =   h 3 10 w    3 5     sin 20 w .  14.   (a) Here the initial-value problem for the charge is   2 T 00   + 24 T 0   + 200 T   = 12   with   T (0) = 0 = 001   and   T 0 (0) = 0 . Then   T f ( w ) =   h 3 6 w ( f 1   cos 8 w   +   f 2   sin 8 w )   and try   T s ( w ) =   D   i   D   =   3 50   and the general solution is  T ( w ) =   h 3 6 w ( f 1   cos 8 w   +   f 2   sin 8 w ) +   3 50   . But   0 = 001 =   T (0) =   f   +   3 50   so   f 1   =   3 0 = 059 . Also  T 0 ( w ) =   L   ( w ) =   h 3 6 w [( 3 6 f 1   + 8 f 2 ) cos 8 w   + ( 3 6 f 2   3   8 f 1 ) sin 8 w ]   and   0 =   T 0 (0) =   3 6 f 1   + 8 f 2   so  f 2   =   3 0 = 04425 . Hence the charge is   T ( w ) =   3 h 3 6 w (0 = 059 cos 8 w   + 0 = 04425 sin 8 w ) +   3 50   and the current is  L ( w ) =   h 3 6 w (0 = 7375) sin 8 w . (b)  15.   As in Exercise 13,   T f ( w ) =   h 3 10 w ( f 1   cos 20 w   +   f 2   sin 20 w )   but   H ( w ) = 12 sin 10 w   so try  T s ( w ) =   D   cos 10 w   +   E   sin 10 w . Substituting into the differential equation gives  ( 3 100 D   + 200 E   + 500 D ) cos 10 w   + ( 3 100 E   3   200 D   + 500 E ) sin 10 w   = 12 sin 10 w   i  400 D   + 200 E   = 0   and   400 E   3   200 D   = 12 . Thus   D   =   3   3 250   ,   E   =   3 125   and the general solution is  T ( w ) =   h 3 10 w ( f 1   cos 20 w   +   f 2   sin 20 w )   3   3 250   cos 10 w   +   3 125   sin 10 w . But   0 =   T (0) =   f 1   3   3 250   so   f 1   =   3 250   . Also   T 0 ( w ) =   3 25   sin 10 w   +   6 25   cos 10 w   +   h 3 10 w [( 3 10 f 1   + 20 f 2 ) cos 20 w   + ( 3 10 f 2   3   20 f 1 ) sin 20 w ]   and  0 =   T 0 (0) =   6 25   3   10 f 1   + 20 f 2   so   f 2   =   3   3 500   .

Substituting into the differential equation gives   ( 3 200 D   + 240 E   + 200 D ) cos 10 w   + ( 3 200 E   3   240 D   + 200 E ) sin 10 w   = 12 sin 10 w , so   E   = 0   and   D   =   3   1 20   . Hence, the general solution is   T ( w ) =   h 3 6 w ( f 1   cos 8 w   +   f 2   sin 8 w )   3   1 20   cos 10 w . But  0 = 001 =   T (0) =   f 1   3   1 20   ,   T 0 ( w ) =   h 3 6 w   [( 3 6 f 1   + 8 f 2 ) cos 8 w   + ( 3 6 f 2   3   8 f 1 ) sin 8 w ]   3   1 2   sin 10 w   and  0 =   T 0 (0) =   3 6 f 1   + 8 f 2 , so   f 1   = 0 = 051   and   f 2   = 0 = 03825 . Thus the charge is given by  T ( w ) =   h 3 6 w (0 = 051 cos 8 w   + 0 = 03825 sin 8 w )   3   1 20   cos 10 w .

(a) We approximate   sin      by      and, with   O   = 1   and   j   = 9 = 8 , the differential equation becomes   g 2  gw 2   + 9 = 8    = 0 . The auxiliary equation is   u 2   + 9 = 8 = 0   i   u   =   ± I 9 = 8   l , so the general solution is    ( w ) =   f 1   cos  I 9 = 8   w      +   f 2   sin  I 9 = 8   w    . Then   0 = 2 =    (0) =   f 1   and   1 =    0 (0) =   I 9 = 8   f 2   i   f 2   =   1 I 9 = 8   , so the equation is   ( w ) = 0 = 2 cos  I 9 = 8   w      +   1 I 9 = 8   sin  I 9 = 8   w    .

Here the initial-value problem is   2 T 00   + 40 T 0   + 400 T   = 12 ,   T   (0) = 0 = 01 ,   T 0 (0) = 0 . Then  T f ( w ) =   h 3 10 w ( f 1   cos 10 w   +   f 2   sin 10 w )   and we try   T s ( w ) =   D . Thus the general solution is  T ( w ) =   h 3 10 w ( f 1   cos 10 w   +   f 2   sin 10 w ) +   3 100   . But   0 = 01 =   T 0 (0) =   f 1   + 0 = 03   and   0 =   T 00 (0) =   3 10 f 1   + 10 f 2 , so   f 1   =   3 0 = 02 =   f 2 . Hence the charge is given by   T ( w ) =   3 0 = 02 h 3 10 w (cos 10 w   + sin 10 w ) + 0 = 03 .  20.   By Hooke’s Law the spring constant is   n   = 64   and the initial-value problem is   2 { 00   + 16 { 0   + 64 {   = 0 ,   { (0) = 0 ,  { 0 (0) = 2 = 4 . Thus the general solution is   { ( w ) =   h 3 4 w ( f 1   cos 4 w   +   f 2   sin 4 w ) . But   0 =   { (0) =   f 1   and  2 = 4 =   { 0 (0) =   3 4 f 1   + 4 f 2   i   f 1   = 0 ,   f 2   = 0 = 6 . Thus the position of the mass is given by   { ( w ) = 0 = 6 h 3 4 w   sin 4 w .  21.   (a) Since we are assuming that the earth is a solid sphere of uniform density, we can calculate the density      as follows:     =   mass of earth volume of earth   =   P  4 3   U 3   . If   Y u   is the volume of the portion of the earth which lies within a distance   u   of the center, then   Y u   =   4 3   u 3   and   P u   =   Y u   =   Pu 3  U 3   . Thus   I u   =   3   JP u   p u 2   =   3   JPp U 3   u . (b) The particle is acted upon by a varying gravitational force during its motion. By Newton’s Second Law of Motion,  p  g 2 | gw 2   =   I |   =   3   JPp U 3   | , so   | 00 ( w ) =   3 n 2 |   ( w )   where   n 2   =   JP U 3   . At the surface,   3 pj   =   I U   =   3   JPp U 2   , so  j   =   JP U 2   . Therefore   n 2   =   j U   .  c °   2012 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

(This is the   u   of Section 17.1, not the   u   measuring distance from the earth’s center.) The roots of the auxiliary equation are   ± ln , so by (11) in Section 17.1, the general solution of our differential equation for   w   is   | ( w ) =   f 1   cos   nw   +   f 2   sin   nw . It follows that  | 0 ( w ) =   3 f 1 n   sin   nw   +   f 2 n   cos   nw . Now   |   (0) =   U   and   | 0 (0) = 0 , so   f 1   =   U   and   f 2 n   = 0 . Thus   | ( w ) =   U   cos   nw   and  | 0 ( w ) =   3 nU   sin   nw . This is simple harmonic motion (see Section 17.3) with amplitude   U , frequency   n , and phase angle   0 . The period is   W   = 2 @n .   U   E   3960 mi = 3960   ·   5280   ft and   j   = 32 ft @ s 2 , so   n   =   s j@U   E   1 = 24   ×   10 3 3   s 3 1   and  W   = 2 @n   E   5079 s   E   85 min .
